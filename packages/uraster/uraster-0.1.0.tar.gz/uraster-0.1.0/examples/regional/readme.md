In a regional simulation, either the source mesh or the source raster (or both) may cover only a portion of the Earth's surface. This is common in applications such as watershed analysis, urban planning, or localized environmental studies.

When setting up a regional analysis, the output mesh will be the minial bounding area that encompasses the source mesh and the source raster(s). This ensures that all relevant data is included in the analysis without unnecessary processing of global data.

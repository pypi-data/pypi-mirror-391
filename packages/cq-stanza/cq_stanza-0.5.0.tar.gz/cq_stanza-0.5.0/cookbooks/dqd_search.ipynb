    "- Review low-score squares in logs - may indicate near-misses\n",

    "- Reduce resolution: lower `high_res_csd_points` (e.g., 32 instead of 48)\n",
    "- Reduce `max_samples` for faster termination\n",
    "- Set `num_dqds_for_exit: 1` to exit after first DQD\n",
    "- Consider using `include_diagonals: false` for sparser exploration\n",

    "**4. False positive DQD classifications**\n",
    "- Review high-res CSD visualizations for charge stability patterns\n",
    "- Consider adding manual validation of top candidates\n",
    "- Check for systematic noise or measurement artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Voltages out of bounds during sweep**\n",
    "- Check that `barrier_voltages` respect safe bounds from leakage test\n",
    "- Verify gate characterization voltages are within device voltage ranges\n",
    "- The algorithm automatically skips out-of-bounds grid squares"

    "## 12. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always complete health check first** - DQD search requires gate characterization results\n",
    "2. **Start with fixed barriers** - Use `run_dqd_search_fixed_barriers` before full barrier sweep\n",
    "3. **Use appropriate resolution** - Balance measurement quality vs time:\n",
    "   - Quick exploration: 16×16 or 32×32 high-res CSD\n",
    "   - Publication quality: 48×48 or 64×64 high-res CSD\n",
    "4. **Monitor peak spacing results** - If peak spacing seems wrong, adjust voltage scale range\n",
    "5. **Review search progress** - Check logged data to understand where search is focusing\n",
    "6. **Validate DQD discoveries** - Visually inspect high-res CSDs for proper DQD features\n",
    "7. **Set reasonable exit conditions** - `num_dqds_for_exit=1` is often sufficient\n",
    "8. **Use reproducible seeds** - Set `seed` parameter for reproducible random sweeps\n",
    "9. **Save barrier configurations** - Record successful barrier voltages for future tuning\n",
    "10. **Iterate on parameters** - If search fails, adjust voltage ranges or resolution"

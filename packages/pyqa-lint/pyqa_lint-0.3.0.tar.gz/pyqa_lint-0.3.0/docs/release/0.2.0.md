# PyQA 0.2.0 (Phase 6 Hardening)

## Highlights

* Finalised the runtime/spec split by documenting the dual-package layout
  (`pyqa` runtime, `tooling_spec` specification) and ensuring the catalog loader
  delegates through typed façades.
* Declared spaCy (with the `en_core_web_sm` model) and the full tree-sitter
  grammar set as mandatory dependencies; the CLI now fails fast when they are
  missing instead of degrading silently.
* Documented the final package structure in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  (superseding the temporary `docs/reorg/*` series) alongside
  `docs/tooling/TOOL_CATALOG_GUIDE.md` and other refreshed references that
  describe the authoring flow.

## Developer Experience

* Refresh of CLI developer docs to reflect the reorganised `commands/*` layout
  and shared infrastructure under `cli/core/`.
* Catalog authoring guide now highlights the standalone spec package so
  downstream tooling can consume the same models without relying on runtime
  internals.

## Release Preparation

* Captured dependency graph statistics in `reorg/artifacts/phase6/` to verify
  layering before tagging.
* Updated README guidance to reinforce the mandatory dependency story and the
  new publishing flow.

## Upgrade Notes

* Install spaCy’s `en_core_web_sm` model (see README) and ensure tree-sitter
  build prerequisites are available in CI before upgrading.
* Update imports to the new module paths (`pyqa.reporting.advice.builder`,
  `pyqa.catalog.*` façades, `tooling_spec.catalog.*`) if you maintain local
  integrations.

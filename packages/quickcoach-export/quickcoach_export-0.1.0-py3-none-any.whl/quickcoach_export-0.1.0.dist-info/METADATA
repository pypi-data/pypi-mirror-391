# QuickCoach Data Export

Export your workout history from QuickCoach to CSV files.

## Usage

1. Install `uv` if not already installed by running the following command:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. If you don't have the Chrome browser installed, you'll need to install it ([available here](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/)).

3. Run directly with `uvx`, specifying your personal QuickCoache URL slug. For example, if your QuickCoach URL is https://app.quickcoach.fit/pt/fitcojoseph123, then your slug is everything that appears after `http://app.qickcoach.fit/`:
   ```bash
   uvx quickcoach-export --slug pt/fitcojoseph123
   ```

### What it does

- Opens QuickCoach in an automated browser
- Extracts all workout history across all your plans
- Creates two CSV files:
  - `quickcoach-{slug}.csv` - Long format (one row per exercise/date)
  - `quickcoach-pivot-{slug}.csv` - Wide format (exercises as rows, dates as columns)

### Options

- `--delay 0.2` - Add delay between scraping exercises (default: 0.15 seconds)
- `--headful` - Show browser window while running (useful for debugging)
- `--skip-pivot` - Only create the long-format CSV

### Example

```bash
# Basic usage
uvx quickcoach-export --slug pt/fitcojoseph123

# With custom delay and visible browser
uvx quickcoach-export --slug pt/fitcojoseph123 --delay 0.3 --headful

# From local repo
uv run quickcoach-export --slug pt/fitcojoseph123
```

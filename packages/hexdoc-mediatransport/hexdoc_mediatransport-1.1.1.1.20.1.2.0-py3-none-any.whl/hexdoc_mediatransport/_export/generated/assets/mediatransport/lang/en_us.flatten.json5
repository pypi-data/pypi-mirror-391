The system is balance around one usage of $(l:hexcasting:patterns/figura#mediatransport:send_fsb)Submit Iota$(/l) consuming 1.00 'power'.$(br2)$(li)$(n)rateLimitChargePerTick/$ controls how quickly 'power' recharges. The default of 1.0 means that on average a player can only use Submit Iota once every tick./$$(li)$(n)rateLimitMaxValue/$ is the maximum 'power' that players can hold on to at once. Setting this below 1 means that Submit Iota will always fail. Setting this greater than 1 lets players send in 'bursts' without running into the rate limit as long as their overall rate remains below the limit./$$(li)$(n)interSendConstMultiplier/$ lets you configure how much Submit Iota II costs relative to Submit Iota. Because Submit Iota costs 1, this is effectively the price of Submit Iota II", "mediatransport.book.figura_see_also_1": "I've cataloged the rest of the details in these entries.", "mediatransport.book.see_also": "See Also", "mediatransport.book.index": "Transports: Index", "mediatransport.book.index.desc": "An index of all the entries related to transports and Figura.", "mediatransport.book.blank": "$(#b0b0b0)this page left blank for layout purposes/$", "mediatransport.book.blank_dark": "$(#504060)this page left blank for layout purposes/$", "mediatransport.not_sendable.bad_type": "that type of iota can't be sent", "mediatransport.not_sendable.corrupt": "it's corrupted or ill-formed", "mediatransport.not_sendable.matrix_too_big": "it's too big", "mediatransport.not_sendable.matrix_too_many_rows": "it has too many rows (max 255)", "mediatransport.not_sendable.matrix_too_many_cols": "it has too many columns (max 255)", "mediatransport.radio_silence_options.crickets": "*crickets*", "mediatransport.radio_silence_options.ellipsis": "......", "mediatransport.radio_silence_options.help": "Receiving queue is empty", "mediatransport.radio_silence_options.eof": "java.util.NoSuchElementException: collection is empty", "mediatransport.radio_silence_options.insanity": "You hear whispering, but you can't make it out.", "mediatransport.radio_silence_options.informal": "there's nothing here.", "mediatransport.mishap_names.init_fail": "Transport Init Failure", "mediatransport.mishap_names.bad_type": "Not a Submittable Iota", "mediatransport.mishap_names.corrupted": "Corrupt Iota", "mediatransport.mishap_names.matrix_too_large": "Matrix Too Large", "mediatransport.mishap_names.iota_too_large": "Send Too Large", "mediatransport.mishap_names.iota_too_large_inter": "Send Other Too Large", "mediatransport.mishap_names.radio_silence": "Nothing to Accept", "mediatransport.mishap_names.rate_limit_exceeded": "Too Fast", "hexcasting.action.mediatransport:send_fsb": "Submit Iota", "hexcasting.action.mediatransport:send_other": "Submit Iota II", "hexcasting.action.mediatransport:recv_fsb": "Accept Iota", "hexcasting.action.mediatransport:check_queue": "Semaphore's Reflection", "hexcasting.action.mediatransport:check_rate_limit": "Quota's Reflection", "hexcasting.action.mediatransport:send_server_info": "Query Configuration", "hexcasting.action.book.mediatransport:check_queue": "Semaphore's Refl.", "hexcasting.mishap.not_sendable": "can't send %s", "hexcasting.mishap.not_sendable_ex": "can't send %s because %s", "hexcasting.mishap.too_large_to_send": "can't send: calculated size at least %s B, but server configured limit is %s B", "hexcasting.mishap.too_large_to_send_inter": "can't send to other players: calculated size at least %s B, but server configured limit is %s B", "hexcasting.mishap.fsb_not_initialized": "Figura server isn't initialized (tell your local admin to use a dedicated server and install FSB)", "hexcasting.mishap.radio_silence": "%s", "hexcasting.mishap.rate_limit_exceeded": "Sending data too fast (%s required, %s available; +%s/tick, max %s)", "hexdoc.mediatransport.title": "mediatransport book", "hexdoc.mediatransport.description": "The Hex Casting + Figura Server Backend Addon", "hexdoc.mediatransport.categories.admin_virtual": "mediatransport admin", "hexdoc.mediatransport.categories.admin_virtual.desc": "This category is $(bold)hexdoc only/$ (not in in-game book) and contains information for server administrators installing mediatransport and FSB.", "opengraph.descriptions.api": "mediatransport for avatar scripts"}

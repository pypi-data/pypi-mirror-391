msgid "Creating Images"
msgstr ""

msgid "This example focuses on creating 2D image objects in Sigima."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are three primary methods to create images in Sigima:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Synthetic data generation**: Using built-in parameter classes to create standard"
msgstr ""

msgid "image types (Gaussian, ramp, random distributions, etc.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Loading from files**: Importing data from various file formats"
msgstr ""

msgid "**From NumPy arrays**: Creating objects directly from existing arrays"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each method has its use cases, and Sigima provides a consistent interface for working with data regardless of its origin."
msgstr ""

msgid "For visualization, we use helper functions from the ``sigima.tests.vistools`` module. This allows us to focus on Sigima's functionality rather than visualization details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Importing necessary modules"
msgstr ""

msgid "First of all, we need to import the required modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "Method 1: Creating images from synthetic parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to signals, Sigima can generate synthetic images using parameter classes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Available image types include:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Distributions: Normal (Gaussian noise), Uniform, Poisson"
msgstr ""

msgid "Analytical functions: 2D Gaussian, 2D ramp (bilinear form)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blank images: Zeros"
msgstr ""

msgid "Qt widget 1"
msgstr ""

msgid "Method 2: Loading images from files"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sigima supports a wide range of image file formats, both common and scientific."
msgstr ""

msgid "Supported formats include:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Common formats: BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, JPEG 2000"
msgstr ""

msgid "Scientific formats: DICOM, Andor SIF, Spiricon, Dürr NDT"
msgstr ""

msgid "Data formats: NumPy (.npy), MATLAB (.mat), HDF5 (.h5img)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Text formats: CSV, TXT, ASC (with coordinate support)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Method 3: Creating images from NumPy arrays"
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert existing NumPy arrays into Sigima image objects to add metadata, coordinate systems, and enable advanced processing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summary"
msgstr ""

msgid "This example demonstrated the three main ways to create images in Sigima:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Synthetic generation**: Fast creation of standard mathematical functions and distributions using parameter classes. Perfect for testing and simulation."
msgstr ""

msgid "**File loading**: Read data from various scientific and common file formats, with automatic format detection and metadata extraction. Essential for working with experimental data."
msgstr ""

msgid "**NumPy array conversion**: Wrap existing array data with Sigima's rich metadata and processing capabilities. Ideal for custom workflows and integration with other Python libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid "All three methods produce equivalent Sigima objects that can be processed, analyzed, and visualized using the same set of tools and functions. Choose the method that best fits your workflow and data source."

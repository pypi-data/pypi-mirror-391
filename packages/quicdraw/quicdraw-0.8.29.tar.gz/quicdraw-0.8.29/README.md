QuicDraw is a security research tool designed for fuzzing and racing HTTP/3 servers.
QuicDraw implements the `Quic-Fin-Sync` on HTTP/3 (over QUIC), for race-condition testing.

The tool was originally published as part of CyberArk Labs' research: "[Racing and Fuzzing HTTP/3: Open-sourcing QuicDraw(H3)](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/racing-and-fuzzing-http-3-open-sourcing-quicdraw)"

##  Main Features

- Implements the `Quic-Fin-Sync` on HTTP3 (over QUIC), for race-condition testing.
- Supports fuzzing multiple requests with the `FUZZ` and wordlist (`-w` argument) mechanisms.
- Custom HTTP headers functionality (`-H` argument).
  - Note: Custom headers are converted to lowercase since we have seen issues with some server implementations.
- Supports SSLKEYLOGFILE (`-l` argument) for TLS decryption/inspection via packet analyzers such as Wireshark.
- Based on aioquic (http3_client)
  - [aioquic](https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic) is a library for the QUIC network protocol in Python.
  - It features a minimal TLS 1.3 implementation, a QUIC stack, and an HTTP/3 stack.

## Quick Start

Prerequisite:

- python >=3.9
- pip3

### Install using pip

The easiest way to install QuicDraw is to run:

```bash
pip install quicdraw
```

#### Runninig (after pip install)

```bash
quicdraw -h
```

### Build and install locally by cloning the source (optional)

If there are no wheels for your system or if you wish to build QuicDraw from source.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberark/quicdrawh3.git
python3 -m build
pip install .\dist\quicdraw-<VERSION>.tar.gz
```

Install module dependencies. (You may prefer to do this within a [Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/))

## Usage

### Print Help

```bash
quicdraw -h
```

### Normal HTTP/3 (over QUIC) Requests

#### An HTTP/3 GET Request

```bash
quicdraw <https://http3_server.com/path>
```

#### An HTTP/3 POST Request

HTTP POST requests are determined by using the `-d` argument followed by the HTTP POST data to be sent.

```bash
quicdraw <https://http3_server.com/path> -d '{"key":"value"}'
```

### Log TLS Secrets to file `-l SECRETS_LOG`

log secrets to a file, for use with Wireshark

To inspect the traffic in wireshark: Open Wireshark → Edit → Preferences → Protocols → TLS
and set “(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename” to the full path of secrets.log

### Verbose logging `-v`

Using the verbose (`-v`) output will log (print) the request data to be sent and the HTTP response content.

In the case of GET requests (no `-d` argument supplied), the request URL (:path) will be logged (printed).

### Testing Race-Conditions in HTTP3 applications `-tr TOTAL_REQUESTS`

To use the same request multiple times (using the `Quic-Fin-Sync` / `single-packet`), use the `-tr/--total-requests` argument.

Note: If a WORDLIST (`-w`) argument is specified, this argument (`-tr TOTAL_REQUESTS`) is overridden by the wordlist number of lines.

#### Racing example

##### Repeat the same request 12 times (`-tr 12`) (using `Quic-Fin-Sync`)

```bash
quicdraw <https://http3_server.com/path> -d '{"key":"value"}' -H 'Authorization: bearer eyJ...' -tr 12
```

##### Repeat the same request 12 times (`-tr 12`), use `Quic-Fin-Sync` and log (`-l`) TLS secrets

```bash
quicdraw <https://http3_server.com/path> -d '{"key":"value"}' -H 'Authorization: bearer eyJ...' -H 'content-type: application/json' -l /m2a/ssl_key_log_file.log -tr 12
```

##### Repeat the same request 12 times (`-tr 12`), use `Quic-Fin-Sync`, log (`-l`) TLS secrets, and print verbose (`-v`) output including HTTP response content

```bash
quicdraw <https://http3_server.com/path> -d '{"key": "value"}' -H 'Authorization: bearer eyJ...' -H 'content-type: application/json' -l /m2a/ssl_key_log_file.log -tr 12 -v
```

### Fuzzing HTTP3 applications `-d` DATA `-w` WORDLIST

Fuzzing in QuicDraw is based on a simple concept, like other web fuzzers ([Ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf), [Wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz)),
go over the data section (`-d`), and replace any reference to the `FUZZ` keyword with the value given in the wordlist (`-w`) as the payload.

To define fuzzing, use the wordlist (`-w`/`--wordlist`) argument with the `FUZZ` keyword anywhere in the DATA (`-d argument`) section.

Note: If the payload (`-d`) does not include the `FUZZ` keyword, the same data will be sent according to the _number of lines_ in the wordlist file.

#### Fuzzing Example

##### Use `Quic-Fin-Sync`, go over the data section (`-d`), and replace any reference to the `FUZZ` keyword with the value given in the wordlist file (`-w`) as the payload

```bash
quicdraw <https://http3_server.com/path> -w path/to/wordlist -d '{"example_key":"FUZZ"}'
```

## Limitations

- The `Quic-Fin-Sync` is mostly effective in POST requests (using the `-d` argument).
  - GET requests will benefit from the mechanism, but according to our tests, only a few requests "fit" on a single QUIC packet.
- The fuzzing mechanism (`FUZZ` and `--wordlist/-w`) only works in POST messages data **or** in the GET request URL (:path) argument.
- Currently, the fuzzing mechanism only works **once**, meaning if the data argument is supplied (`-d`), we assume fuzzing on the POST data, supplying the `FUZZ` keyword in the URL (:path) will result in sending the URL (:path) as-is (including the `FUZZ` keyword).
- We do not support multiple different domains in the current version. (For different paths, you can use the FUZZ keyword in the URL's path part)

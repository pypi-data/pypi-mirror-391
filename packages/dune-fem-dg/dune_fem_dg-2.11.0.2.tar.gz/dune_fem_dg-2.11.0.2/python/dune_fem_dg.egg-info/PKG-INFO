DUNE-FEM-DG
===========

DUNE-FEM-DG is the implementation of Discontinuous Galerkin schemes
using the DUNE-FEM framework. Stabilized DG schemes for hyperbolic
as well as a wide range of different primal formulations
for elliptic/parabolic problems are implemented.
The operators can be used efficiently both in a
explicit/matrix free implementation or used to
setup a system matrix for use with the linear solvers available in DUNE-FEM.

While there's no built-in `kurt create-project` CLI command, you can:\n- Add content using: `kurt content add <url>`\n- Create projects manually in the `projects/` directory\n- Use other Kurt commands like `kurt status`, `kurt content list`, etc.\n\nThe `/create-project` slash command mentioned in the status output may need to be set up separately as a custom Claude Code command, but it's not currently available in this environment.",

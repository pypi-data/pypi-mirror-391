Fixit provides a highly configurable linting framework with support for
auto-fixes, custom "local" lint rules, and hierarchical configuration, built
on `LibCST <https://libcst.rtfd.io>`_.

Fixit makes it quick and easy to write new lint rules and offer suggested
changes for any errors found, which can then be accepted automatically,
or presented to the user for consideration.


**Fixit 2.0 has been rebuilt for better configuration and support for custom
lint rules.** If you are using Fixit 0.1.4 or older, take a look at the
`legacy documentation <https://fixit.rtfd.io/en/v0.1.4/>`_
or the `stable branch <https://github.com/Instagram/Fixit/tree/0.x>`_.
See the `upgrade guide <https://fixit.rtfd.io/en/latest/upgrade.html>`_
for tools and information to migrate existing configuration and lint rules
and ensure compatibility with the latest version of Fixit.

For more details, see the `user guide`__.

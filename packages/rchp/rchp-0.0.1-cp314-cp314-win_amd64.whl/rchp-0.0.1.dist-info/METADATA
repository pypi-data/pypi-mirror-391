# rchp

Run the following command to install rchp:

```
pip install rchp
```
No dependencies need to be installed.

rchp supports Python 3.10+

The usage of its main function `parallel` is as follows:

```python
import rchp
import time
def task():
    for i in range(20):
        print(f"Task: {i}")
rchp.parallel(func=task, worker=2, wait=False)
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Main: {i*i}")
time.sleep(0.5)
```

`func` is the function to be parallelized.  
`worker` is the number of threads.  
`wait` indicates whether the main thread waits for the threads to complete their tasks.

1. The first parameter does not accept functions with arguments.  
2. If an exception is thrown within the function, loss of information may occur or it may manifest as process terminated with exit code -1073740791 (0xC0000409). Please ensure there are no errors in the function.

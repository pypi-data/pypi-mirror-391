                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Mobly Android Screen Recorder

Mobly Android Screen Recorder service for using Python code to screencast the
Android devices in Mobly tests (https://github.com/google/mobly).

This tool is upgraded to scrcpy v3.3 and adds audio recording feature.

## Responsible Use

This tool is designed for legitimate testing and debugging purposes within the
context of Mobly. It should only be used in situations where you have:

* **Explicit consent:** Obtain clear and informed consent from any individuals
* whose screens might be recorded.
* **Legitimate purpose:**  Use the tool for legitimate testing, debugging,
* or development activities related to Mobly.
* **Data security:**  Handle recorded screen data responsibly. Store it
* securely and delete it when it's no longer needed.
* **Transparency:** Be transparent about how the tool is being used and what
* data is being collected.

**Misuse of this tool for unauthorized surveillance or any other malicious
activity is strictly prohibited.**

**Remember:** Recording someone's screen without their knowledge or consent
is a serious breach of privacy and may have legal consequences. 

## Requirements

-   Python 3.11+
-   Mobly 1.12.2+
-   FFMPEG 6.1.1+

Please make sure your FFMPEG support H.264 (run `ffmpeg -codecs` and
look for **libx264** encoder in the output) and the OpenCV in Python built
with the H.264 encoder(`print(cv2.getBuildInformation())` then look at the
Video I/O section).

**Note:** To use the audio recording feature, you must have `ffmpeg` installed
and available in your system's PATH.

## Installation

```shell
pip install mobly-android-screen-recorder
```

## Start to Use

After initializing the Android device, you can register the screen recorder
service with the following code:

```python
from mobly.controllers.android_device_lib.services import screen_recorder
...

self.dut = self.register_controller(android_device)[0]
# To enable audio recording, set `enable_audio=True` in the configs.
configs = screen_recorder.Configs(enable_audio=True)
self.dut.services.register('screen_recorder', screen_recorder.ScreenRecorder, configs=configs)
```

Then the screen recorder will start recording the screen when the test starts
and stop recording when the test finishes. The screen recording will be saved to
the test output folder as a video file during teardown process for each test
case with **create_output_excerpts_all** for all registered Mobly services.

## Example 1: Hello World!

 Let's start with the simple example of posting "Hello World" on the Android
device's screen. Create the following files:   **sample_config.yml**

```yaml
TestBeds:
  # A test bed where adb will find Android devices.
  - Name: SampleTestBed
    Controllers:
        AndroidDevice: '*'
```

**hello_world_test.py**

```python
from mobly import base_test
from mobly import test_runner
from mobly.controllers import android_device
from mobly.controllers.android_device_lib.services import screen_recorder

class HelloWorldTest(base_test.BaseTestClass):

  def setup_class(self):
    # Registering android_device controller module declares the test's
    # dependency on Android device hardware. By default, we expect at least one
    # object is created from this.
    self.ads = self.register_controller(android_device)
    self.dut = self.ads[0]
    # Start Mobly Bundled Snippets (MBS).
    self.dut.load_snippet('mbs', android_device.MBS_PACKAGE)
    # Register screen recorder service, it will start recording when the test
    # starts and stop recording when the test finishes.
    # To enable audio recording, set `enable_audio=True` in the configs.
    configs = screen_recorder.Configs(enable_audio=True)
    self.dut.services.register('screen_recorder', screen_recorder.ScreenRecorder, configs=configs)

  def test_hello(self):
    self.dut.mbs.makeToast('Hello World!')

  def teardown_test(self):
    self.dut.services.create_output_excerpts_all(self.current_test_info)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  test_runner.main()
```

To execute:

```
$ python hello_world_test.py -c sample_config.yml
```

*Expect*:

A "Hello World!" toast notification appears on your device's screen. And a video
file named `video,{device_serial},{device_model},{timestamp}.mp4` is created in
the test output folder.

## Disclaimer

This tool, owned by Google and its developers, provides screen recording functionality for Android devices within the context of Mobly testing. It is essential to use this tool responsibly and ethically. 

**Privacy Warning:** Screen recording can capture sensitive information. **Always obtain explicit consent before recording anyone's screen.** Unauthorized screen recording may violate privacy laws and ethical guidelines. Neither Google nor the developers of this tool are responsible for any misuse or illegal activity conducted with this software.

Users of this tool are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection.

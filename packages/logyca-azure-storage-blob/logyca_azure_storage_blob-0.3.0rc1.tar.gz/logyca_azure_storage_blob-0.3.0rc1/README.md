# LOGYCA public libraries: To interact with the blob container files in your Azure Storage account.

[Source code](https://github.com/logyca/python-libraries/tree/main/logyca-azure-storage-blob)
| [Package (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/logyca-azure-storage-blob/)
| [Samples](https://github.com/logyca/python-libraries/tree/main/logyca-azure-storage-blob/samples)

To install the libraries

```Python
# Check SQLAlchemy dependency that is installed
pip install logyca_azure_storage_blob
```


# How azcopy performs file consistency validation

Like azcopy, Microsoft's client for uploading large files to Blob, the md5 hash must be computed locally and uploaded to the blob properties along with the file, the blob service will commit this at the end of the process, returning an error if presents inconsistency in value.

## Calculates the MD5 hash of the file content and saves it as the Content-MD5 property of the blob:


```console
azcopy --put-md5 #
```

References:

    - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy-copy

This library uses the concepts of the azcopy client for its implementation.

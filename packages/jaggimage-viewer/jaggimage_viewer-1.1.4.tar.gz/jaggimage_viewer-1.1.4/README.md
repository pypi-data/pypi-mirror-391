# jaggimage-viewer
I was so used to my 25+ years old version of ACDSee to quickly see my files, i just made my own image viewer with Python and Qt.

## Usage

- You can run it without argument in any directory containing pictures, it will show the first of files with any recognized extension, and next/prev will show others files in current directory
- You can run it with one file name as argument to display it (or associate jaggimage-viewer with images files), next/prev will also show others files of the same directory
- You can run it with several files as argument, the first one will be displayed, next/prev will show others images you listed

## Shortcuts

Most keyboard shortcuts are shown in the contextual menu (right click), but some functions have several. I tried to keep the sames shortcuts than ACDSee.

# ============================================================================
# STANDARDIZED METRIC NAMING CONVENTION (Based on SAS - Most Generic)
# ============================================================================
# Each metric scores 1-4, sum is 10-40, normalized to 100-point scale (25-100)
# Weights are kept for consistency but don't affect scoring (all equal at 10)
#
# Standard 10 Dimensions (Language-Agnostic):
# 1. script_size_structure           - Lines, procedures, functions, nesting depth
# 2. dependency_footprint            - Databases, tables, libraries, external references
# 3. analytics_depth                 - Aggregations, statistical operations, analytics
# 4. sql_reporting_logic             - Queries, joins, reporting complexity
# 5. transformation_logic            - Data manipulation, conversions, transformations
# 6. utility_complexity              - Functions, procedures, macros, utilities
# 7. execution_control               - Transactions, flow control, orchestration
# 8. file_io_external_integration    - File I/O, remote systems, external data
# 9. ods_output_delivery             - Output formats, result delivery, reporting
# 10. error_handling_optimization    - Error handling, performance, optimization
# ============================================================================

# Classification thresholds (100-point scale)
# Base score range: 25-100 (10 metrics × 1-4 scale, normalized)
# With cyclomatic enabled: adds up to +10 bonus (total max 100, capped)
#
# Thresholds based on empirical testing and industry standards:
# Simple: ≤32 (basic operations, minimal features, mostly 1s)
# Medium: 33-50 (moderate complexity, mix of 1s and 2s)  
# Complex: 51-70 (extensive processing, advanced features, mix of 2s and 3s)
# Very Complex: 71-100 (enterprise-grade, comprehensive features, 3s and 4s)

# Note: Language-specific sections (sas, sybase, oracle, etc.) are optional.
# All languages use the standardized metric naming above by default.
# Add language-specific overrides only if custom weights/thresholds are needed.

    clinical_significance: "LF power <200 ms² indicates impaired baroreflex function associated with orthostatic intolerance and increased falls risk. LF >1500 ms² may indicate hypertensive vascular damage or excessive sympathetic tone. LF/HF ratio interpretation controversial; absolute LF value more reliable than ratio. Beta-blockers reduce LF by 40-60%."

  interpretation:
    in_range: "A normal PPR ratio indicates appropriate oxygen saturation, suggesting that the patient’s lungs and cardiovascular system are adequately oxygenating blood."
    below_range: "A low PPR ratio often correlates with reduced oxygenation, potentially indicating conditions like hypoxia, lung disease, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
    above_range: "A high PPR ratio may suggest measurement errors or abnormal oxygen saturation levels, which could be caused by vascular abnormalities or poor signal quality."
  contradiction:
    spo2: "Abnormal PPR contradicts normal SpO2 values, as both should reflect similar oxygen saturation levels."
  correlation:
    oxygenation_levels: "Correlated with oxygen saturation levels and respiratory function, as PPR reflects the ratio of infrared and red light absorption."
  thresholds:
    contradiction:
      spo2:
        strong: 0.3   # Strong contradiction if PPR differs by more than 30% from expected SpO2 values.
        slight: 0.1   # Slight contradiction for differences between 10% and 30%.
    correlation:
      oxygenation_levels:
        strong: 0.05  # Strong correlation if within 5%.
        slight: 0.15  # Slight correlation if within 15%.

# Changelog

## Version 0.3.0 - 0.3.3

- Support for string dimensions when creating cellarr arrays.
- Support query conditions for slice operations.
- Support sparse writes on dense arrays.
- Added unique dim values. Only supported for sparse arrays.
- Fix a minor bug causing memory leaks on large sparse arrays.
- Fix an issue when domain is max dimension.
- EOL for Python 3.9

## Version 0.2.0

- Dataloaders for sparse and dense arrays, We provide templates for both map and Iterable style dataloaders. Users are expected the caveats of both of these approaches.
- Fixed a bug with slicing on 1D arrays and many improvements for optimizing slicing parameters.
- Update documentation and tests.

## Version 0.1.0

- Support cellarr-arrays on user provided tiledb array objects.
- Migrate github actions to the newer version from biocsetup.
- Renaming module names, documentation and tests

## Version 0.0.2

- Support in-memory tiledb objects. Updated tests and documentation.

## Version 0.0.1

Initial implementation of the sparse and dense arrays backed by TileDB.

- Supports reading of objects
  - Directly slices the TileDB object is all arguments to subset are contiguous blocks.
  - Otherwise redirects them to `multi_index`, if one of the argument to subset is a slice, drops the last because of inclusive upper bounds in this method.

  This helps keeps slicing consistent across various operations and trying to be performant in the process.

- Supports writing of various data objects into dense and sparse arrays. Expects all chunks to be aligned along the rows.

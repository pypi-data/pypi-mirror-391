python-libevdev - Python wrapper for libevdev
=============================================

This project is a Python wrapper around libevdev, taking advantage of
libevdev's advanced event handling. Documentation is available here:
https://python-libevdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

libevdev makes it easy to

* read and parse events from an input device
* create a virtual input device and make it send events
* duplicate an existing device and modify the event stream

For information about libevdev see here:

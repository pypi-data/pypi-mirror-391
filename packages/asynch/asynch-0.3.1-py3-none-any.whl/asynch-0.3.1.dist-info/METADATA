               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         
               To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
               the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
               comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
               file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
               same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
               identification within third-party archives.

## Introduction

`asynch` is an asynchronous ClickHouse Python driver with native TCP interface support, which reuses most of [clickhouse-driver](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver) features and complies with [PEP249](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/).

## Installation

```shell
> pip install asynch
```

If you want to install [`clickhouse-cityhash`](https://pypi.org/project/clickhouse-cityhash/) to enable transport compression

```shell
> pip install asynch[compression]
```

## Release v0.3.0 announcement

The version 0.2.5 should have been the v0.3.0 due to compatibility-breaking changes.
Before upgrading to the v0.3.0, please pay attention to the incompatible changes like:

- The `asynch/connection.py::connect` function is removed - you can use the `async with` a Connection instance.
- The `asynch/connection.py::Connection.connected` property is renamed to `opened`.
- The `asynch/pool.py::create_pool` function is removed - you can use the `async with` a Pool instance.
- The deprecated methods from `Connection`, `Cursor` and `Pool` classes are removed.

For more details, please refer to the project [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Usage

Basically, a connection to a ClickHouse server can be established in two ways:

1. with a DSN string, e.g., `clickhouse://[user:password]@host:port/database`;

    ```python
    from asynch import Connection

    # connecting with a DSN string
    async def connect_database():
        async with Connection(
            dsn = "clickhouse://ch_user:P@55w0rD:@127.0.0.1:9000/chdb",
        ) as conn:
            pass
    ```

2. with separately given connection/DSN parameters: `user` (optional), `password` (optional), `host`, `port`, `database`.

    ```python
    from asynch import Connection

    # connecting with DSN parameters
    async def connect_database():
        async with Connection(
            user = "ch_user",
            password = "P@55w0rD",
            host = "127.0.0.1",
            port = 9000,
            database = "chdb",
        ) as conn:
            pass
    ```

If a DSN string is given, it takes priority over any specified connection parameter.

Create a database and a table by executing SQL statements via an instance of the `Cursor` class (here its child `DictCursor` class) acquired from an instance of the `Connection` class.

```python
async def create_table(conn: Connection):
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS test")
        await cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE if not exists test.asynch
            (
                `id`       Int32,
                `decimal`  Decimal(10, 2),
                `date`     Date,
                `datetime` DateTime,
                `float`    Float32,
                `uuid`     UUID,
                `string`   String,
                `ipv4`     IPv4,
                `ipv6`     IPv6
            )
            ENGINE = MergeTree
            ORDER BY id
            """
        )
```

Fetching one row from an executed SQL statement:

```python
async def fetchone(conn: Connection):
    # by default, an instance of the `Cursor` class
    async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
        ret = await cursor.fetchone()
        assert ret == (1,)
```

Fetching all the rows from an executed SQL statement:

```python
async def fetchall():
    async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
        ret = await cursor.fetchall()
        assert ret == [(1,)]
```

Using an instance of the `DictCursor` class to get results as a sequence of `dict`ionaries representing the rows of an executed SQL query:

```python
async def dict_cursor():
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
        ret = await cursor.fetchall()
        assert ret == [{"1": 1}]
```

Inserting data with `dict`s via a `DictCursor` instance:

```python
from asynch.cursors import DictCursor

async def insert_dict():
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        ret = await cursor.execute(
            """INSERT INTO test.asynch(id,decimal,date,datetime,float,uuid,string,ipv4,ipv6) VALUES""",
            [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "decimal": 1,
                    "date": "2020-08-08",
                    "datetime": "2020-08-08 00:00:00",
                    "float": 1,
                    "uuid": "59e182c4-545d-4f30-8b32-cefea2d0d5ba",
                    "string": "1",
                    "ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
                    "ipv6": "::",
                }
            ],
        )
        assert ret == 1
```

Inserting data with `tuple`s:

```python
async def insert_tuple():
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        ret = await cursor.execute(
            """INSERT INTO test.asynch(id,decimal,date,datetime,float,uuid,string,ipv4,ipv6) VALUES""",
            [
                (
                    1,
                    1,
                    "2020-08-08",
                    "2020-08-08 00:00:00",
                    1,
                    "59e182c4-545d-4f30-8b32-cefea2d0d5ba",
                    "1",
                    "0.0.0.0",
                    "::",
                )
            ],
        )
        assert ret == 1
```

### Connection Pool

Before the v0.2.4:

```python
async def use_pool():
    pool = await asynch.create_pool()
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
            await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
            ret = await cursor.fetchone()
            assert ret == (1,)
    pool.close()
    await pool.wait_closed()
```

Since the v0.2.5 -> v0.3.0:

```python
async def use_pool():
    # init a Pool and fill it with the `minsize` opened connections
    async with Pool(minsize=1, maxsize=2) as pool:
        # acquire a connection from the pool
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
                await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
                ret = await cursor.fetchone()
                assert ret == (1,)
```

Or, you may opne/close the pool manually:

```python
async def use_pool():
    pool = Pool(minsize=1, maxsize=2)
    await pool.startup()

    # some logic

    await pool.shutdown()
```

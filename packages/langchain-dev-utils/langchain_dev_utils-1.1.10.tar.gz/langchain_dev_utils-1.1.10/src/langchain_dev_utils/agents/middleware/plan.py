_DEFAULT_WRITE_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
This tool is used to **create a new plan list ** or **modify an existing plan**.

Parameters:
`plan`: A list of strings representing the plans to be executed. The first plan in the list will automatically be set to the "in_progress" status, and all remaining plans will be set to the "pending" status. Internally, each string is converted into a dictionary containing "content" and "status" keys, where "content" corresponds to each string value in the list, and the "status" is assigned according to the rule: the first plan is "in_progress", and all others are "pending".
When modifying a plan, only provide the plans that need to be executed next. For example, if the current plan is ['Plan 1', 'Plan 2', 'Plan 3'], and Plan 1 is completed, but you determine that Plan 2 and Plan 3 are no longer suitable and should be replaced with ['Plan 4', 'Plan 5'], then only pass ['Plan 4', 'Plan 5'].

## Tool Functionality

This tool is used to **create a new plan list** or **modify an existing plan list**.

- **Primary Use**: Create a new plan list.
- **Secondary Use**: Modify the plan when problems are identified with the existing one.
- **Not For**: Marking plans as completed.

## Plan Statuses

Use the following statuses to track progress:

- `pending`: Plan has not yet started.
- `in_progress`: Currently being worked on.
- `done`: Plan has been completed.

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating a Plan (Primary Use)

Call this tool to create a structured plan when dealing with complex tasks:

- Complex multi-step tasks (≥3 steps).
- Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning.
- The user explicitly requests a plan list.

### Modifying a Plan (Special Cases)

Modify an existing plan only under the following circumstances:

- The current plan structure is found to be problematic.
- The plan structure or content needs adjustment.
- The existing plan cannot be executed effectively.

**Important Update Behavior**: When updating a plan, only pass the list of plans that need to be executed next. The tool automatically handles status assignment – the first plan is set to `in_progress`, and the rest are set to `pending`.

### Plan Completion

**Important Note**: When completing a plan, call the `finish_sub_plan()` function to update the plan status. **Do not use this tool**.

## When to Use

**Appropriate Scenarios**:

- When starting a new complex work session.
- When needing to reorganize the plan structure.
- When the current plan needs revision based on new information.

**Scenarios to Avoid**:

- Simple tasks (<3 steps).
- When only needing to mark a plan as complete.
- Purely informational queries or conversation.
- Trivial tasks that can be completed directly.

## Best Practices

1. When creating a plan, the first plan is automatically set to `in_progress`.
2. Ensure sub-plans within the plan are specific and actionable.
3. Break down complex sub-plans into smaller steps.
4. Always keep at least one plan in the `in_progress` status unless all plans are completed.
5. When modifying a plan, only provide the sub-plans that need to be executed next.
6. Use clear, descriptive names for sub-plans.

## Internal Processing Logic

The tool automatically converts the input strings into a structured format:

- Input: `["Sub-plan 1", "Sub-plan 2", "Sub-plan 3"]`
- Internal Representation:
```json
  [
  {"content": "Sub-plan 1", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Sub-plan 2", "status": "pending"},
  {"content": "Sub-plan 3", "status": "pending"}
  ]
```

Please remember:

- For simple plans, execute them directly; there is no need to call this tool.
- Use the `finish_sub_plan()` function to mark sub-plans as completed.
- When modifying a plan, only provide the sub-plans that need to be executed next.
"""

_DEFAULT_FINISH_SUB_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
This tool is used to mark the completion status of a sub-plan in an existing plan.

Functionality:
- Marks the sub-plan with status 'in_progress' as 'done'
- Sets the first sub-plan with status 'pending' to 'in_progress' (if one exists)

## Tool Purpose
Specifically designed to **mark the current sub-plan as completed** in an existing plan.

### When to Use
Use only when the current sub-plan is confirmed complete.

### Automatic Status Management
- `in_progress` → `done`
- First `pending` → `in_progress` (if any)

## Usage Example
Current plan status:
```json
[
    {"content": "Research market trends", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Analyze competitor data", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"content": "Prepare summary report", "status": "pending"}
]
```

After calling finish_sub_plan():
```json
[
    {"content": "Research market trends", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Analyze competitor data", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Prepare summary report", "status": "in_progress"}
]
```

Remember:
- Only for marking completion—do not use to create or modify plans (use write_plan instead)
- Ensure the sub-plan is truly complete before calling
- No parameters needed; status transitions are handled automatically

_PLAN_MIDDLEWARE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You can manage task plans using the following {num} tools:

## 1. write_plan: Create or Replace a Plan
- **Primary Purpose**: Generate a structured execution framework for complex tasks, or completely replace the remaining plan sequence when the current plan is no longer valid.
- **When to Use**:
  - The task requires 3 or more distinct, actionable steps
  - The user explicitly requests a plan list or "to-do plan"
  - The user provides multiple plans (e.g., numbered list, comma-separated items)
  - Execution reveals fundamental flaws in the current plan, requiring a new direction
- **Input Format**: A list of plan description strings, e.g., ["Analyze user needs", "Design system architecture", "Implement core module"]
- **Automatic Status Assignment**:
  - First plan → `"in_progress"`
  - All subsequent plans → `"pending"`
- **Plan Replacement Rule**: Provide **only the new plans that should be executed next**. Do not include completed, obsolete, or irrelevant plans.
- **Plan Quality Requirements**:
  - Plans must be specific, actionable, and verifiable
  - Break work into logical phases (chronological or dependency-based)
  - Define clear milestones and deliverable standards
  - Avoid vague, ambiguous, or non-executable descriptions
- **Do NOT Use When**:
  - The task is simple (<3 steps)
  - The request is conversational, informational, or a one-off query
  - You only need to mark a plan as complete (use `finish_sub_plan` instead)

## 2. finish_sub_plan: Mark Current Plan as Complete
- **Primary Purpose**: Confirm the current `"in_progress"` plan is fully done, mark it as `"done"`, and automatically promote the first `"pending"` plan to `"in_progress"`.
- **Call Only If ALL Conditions Are Met**:
  - The sub-plan has been **fully executed**
  - All specified requirements have been satisfied
  - There are no unresolved errors, omissions, or blockers
  - The output meets quality standards and has been verified
- **Automatic Behavior**:
  - No parameters needed—status transitions are handled internally
  - If no `"pending"` plans remain, the plan ends naturally
- **Never Call If**:
  - The plan is partially complete
  - Known issues or defects remain
  - Execution was blocked due to missing resources or dependencies
  - The result fails to meet expected quality

{read_plan_system_prompt}

## Plan Status Rules (Only These Three Are Valid)
- **`"pending"`**: Plan not yet started
- **`"in_progress"`**: Currently being executed (exactly one allowed at any time)
- **`"done"`**: Fully completed and verified  
> ⚠️ No other status values (e.g., "completed", "failed", "blocked") are permitted.

## General Usage Principles
1. **Execute simple plans directly**: If a request can be fulfilled in 1–2 steps, do not create a plan—just complete it.
2. **Decompose thoughtfully**: Break complex work into clear, independent, trackable sub-plans.
3. **Manage status rigorously**:
   - Always maintain exactly one `"in_progress"` plan while work is ongoing
   - Call `finish_sub_plan` immediately after plan completion—never delay
4. **Plan modification = full replacement**: Never edit individual plans. To adjust the plan, use `write_plan` with a new list of remaining plans.
5. **Respect user intent**: If the user explicitly asks for a plan—even for a simpler task—honor the request and create one.

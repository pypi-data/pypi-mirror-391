# Attack Strategy Definitions Library (Updated Structure)
#
# This file contains a consolidated list of attack strategy configurations that 
# can be loaded by the system. Each entry is a blueprint for an attack strategy.
# Complex structured parameters are now direct fields of the strategy.
# Objective targets use placeholders, adversarial targets use openai/gpt-4o.

# E. Prompt Sending Attack Strategy (Single-Turn)

- name: "prompt-sending-attack"
  display_name: "Prompt Sending Attack Strategy"
  description: |
    A single-turn prompt sending attack strategy that allows you to send prompts to a target
    to try to achieve a specific objective. It evaluates the target response using optional
    scorers to determine if the objective was achieved.
    
    The attack flow consists of:
    1. Preparing the prompt based on the objective
    2. Sending the prompt to the target system through optional converters
    3. Evaluating the response with scorers if configured
    4. Retrying on failure up to the configured number of retries
    5. Returning the attack result with achievement status
    
    This strategy supports customization through converters and multiple scorer types
    for comprehensive evaluation. Prepended conversations and seed groups can be
    provided when executing the attack (via execute_async or execute_with_context_async methods).

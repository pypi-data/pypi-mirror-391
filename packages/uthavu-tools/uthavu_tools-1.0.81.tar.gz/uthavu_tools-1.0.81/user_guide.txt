- Point DNS (A records) for: `2fycleaningsolution.com → 72.60.97.244	` add for bto uthavu.com and www.uthavu.com
- execute [usnginx]

	-> pip show -f uthavu-tools
- copy/move your source code to local system.
- go inside this folder
- execute [createrepo] (will do update the variables for cicd also) 
- execute [ushttps] --> may be fater 30 mins, will take some time to update the dns to our new server 
- need to open the port in hostiner
- http://72.60.97.244:9003/ - should work
- https://test9.uthavu.com/ - should work

Till Success:

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: nginx). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: uthavu.com
  Type:   connection
  Detail: During secondary validation: 162.215.226.4: Fetching http://: Invalid empty host in redirect target

  Domain: www.uthavu.com
  Type:   connection
  Detail: During secondary validation: 162.215.226.4: Fetching http://: Invalid empty host in redirect target

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary nginx configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure the listed domains point to this nginx server and that it is accessible from the internet.

Deploying certificate
Could not install certificate

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate was saved, but could not be installed (installer: nginx). After fixing the error shown below, try installing it again by running:
  certbot install --cert-name test5.uthavu.com

Could not automatically find a matching server block for test5.uthavu.com. Set the `server_name` directive to use the Nginx installer.

This certificate expires on 2025-12-26.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

⚠️ Important note about renewal

Since you used manual DNS challenge, Certbot cannot auto-renew.

Every ~90 days, you’ll need to run the same command again and update the TXT record.

👉 If your DNS provider supports an API (like Cloudflare, AWS Route53, etc.), you can automate DNS validation with --manual-auth-hook or certbot-dns-* plugins. That way, renewals are automatic.

as of now:
step 1: checkin
step 2: merge
step 3: aud --be or your app deploy command

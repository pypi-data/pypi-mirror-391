### Chores

- **release**: Client v0.11.0
  ([`67d0e7d`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/67d0e7dda591a25a37e7ddc738a0da0fc3dc3600))

### Documentation

- Clarify product search is exact match only, remove deprecated methods
  ([`ec96bbc`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/ec96bbc1d6111176bd813541028dbe55ad7402f0))

This change documents and clarifies that the StockTrim Products API only supports exact
code matching, not prefix or partial search. It also removes deprecated methods that had
misleading names.

## Changes

### Documentation - Add API feedback section documenting Products endpoint 404 behavior - Document

that `code` parameter only supports exact matching - Explain why 404 for query filtering
is non-standard REST

### API Client (`stocktrim_public_api_client`) - Update `get_all()` docs to clarify exact match only

- Add `find_by_exact_code()` method with clear naming - Remove deprecated `search()`
  method - Update tests to check for `find_by_exact_code()` instead of `search()`

### MCP Server (`stocktrim_mcp_server`) - Update `find_by_exact_code()` docs with API limitation

note - Remove deprecated `search()` method - Rename tests: `test_search_*` →
`test_find_by_exact_code_*`

## Testing - All 73 public API client tests pass - All 276 MCP server tests pass - Test function

names now match the actual method names

## Breaking Changes Since we're pre-1.0, deprecated methods were removed rather than kept for

backward compatibility: - `ProductService.search()` → use `find_by_exact_code()` instead
\- `Products.search()` → use `find_by_exact_code()` instead

Note: For keyword search functionality across product names, codes, and

categories, use the Order Plan API (implemented in PR #99).

### Features

- Replace product search with keyword search using Order Plan API
  ([#99](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/99),
  [`102cae9`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/102cae9d858581ae3c3cfbd7336ecbf64d53a851))

* feat: replace product search with keyword search using Order Plan API

Replace nearly-useless prefix-based product search with comprehensive keyword search
that works across product names, codes, and categories.

Changes: - tools/foundation/products.py: - Rename SearchProductsRequest.prefix →
search_query - Replace Products API call with Order Plan API searchString - Update
docstring with keyword search examples - tests: Update mocks to use Order Plan API and
SkuOptimizedResultsDto

Benefits: - Search by product name: "blue widget" - Search by category: "electronics" -
Search by partial code: "WIDG" matches "WIDGET-001" - Much more useful than prefix-only
search

Before: search_products(prefix="WIDG") - must know exact prefix

After: search_products(search_query="widget") - natural search

- fix: use OrderPlanFilterCriteria instead of DTO for 415 error

The Order Plan API endpoint expects OrderPlanFilterCriteria, not
OrderPlanFilterCriteriaDto. Using the DTO version caused 415 "Unsupported Media Type"
errors.

Changes: - Import OrderPlanFilterCriteria instead of OrderPlanFilterCriteriaDto - Update
test to be more robust when checking call arguments

Fixes the 415 errors seen in production logs.

- feat: add unpack decorator for flattened MCP parameters

Add @unpack_pydantic_params decorator to enable flattened parameter calls instead of
nested request objects, matching the pattern from katana-mcp.

Changes: - Add unpack.py module with Unpack marker and decorator - Apply decorator to
search_products tool - Update tests to use flattened parameters

Benefits: - Better DX: search_products(search_query="widget") instead of
search_products(request={"search_query": "widget"}) - Maintains Pydantic validation
while exposing flat params to MCP - Compatible with FastMCP's parameter introspection

Pattern from: https://github.com/dougborg/katana-openapi-client

- feat(mcp): implement parameter flattening for all tools

Apply @unpack_pydantic_params decorator to all MCP tools to expose flattened parameters
instead of nested objects. This improves compatibility with Claude Code and other MCP
clients that have issues serializing nested parameter objects.

Changes: - Add unpack.py module with @unpack_pydantic_params decorator (from Katana) -
Apply decorator to all 27 tools across 11 tool files - Update all foundation tool tests
to use flattened parameters - Add ADR 0001 documenting parameter flattening decision -
Update README with parameter flattening pattern documentation

Technical Details: The decorator transforms function signatures at import time: - Scans
for Annotated[Model, Unpack()] parameters - Extracts Pydantic model fields as individual
KEYWORD_ONLY params - Updates __signature__ and __annotations__ for FastMCP
introspection - At runtime, reconstructs validated model instances from flat params

This provides: - Flat parameters for MCP protocol compatibility - Pydantic validation
for type safety - Clean tool code working with typed model objects - Automatic parameter
documentation from Field descriptions

All 276 tests passing.

- fix: address PR review feedback

Address review comments from PR #99:

1. Revert nullable supplier code - The SupplierInfo.code field should remain required
   (str) as it's fundamental for identifying suppliers and the underlying
   SupplierResponseDto has it as non-nullable.

1. Improve 404 handling documentation - Add detailed comment explaining why StockTrim
   API returns 404 for "no results" instead of the more conventional 200 with empty
   list, and why we treat it as expected behavior rather than an error.

1. Fix empty product code handling - Instead of using empty string fallback which
   violates ProductInfo schema, filter out order plan items that have missing/empty
   product codes to prevent creating invalid product records.

- **mcp**: Setup MCP Prompts infrastructure (Issue #101)
  ([#107](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/107),
  [`206db80`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/206db80ce811d41830d341d9901ffa1b16384c43))

* feat(mcp): implement MCP Prompts infrastructure

- Create prompts directory structure with __init__.py and workflows.py - Add
  register_all_prompts() and register_workflow_prompts() functions - Update server.py to
  register prompts after resources - Add test infrastructure in tests/test_prompts/ -
  All tests pass (280 total, including 2 new prompt tests) - Server imports successfully
  with "Prompts registered" log message

* style(mcp): fix formatting in test_workflows.py

* fix: use structured logging for prompts registration

Address review comment to use event-driven logging consistent with the rest of the file
(e.g., 'server_ready', 'client_initialized').

Changed 'Prompts registered' to 'prompts_registered' to match the structured logging
pattern.

  ([#81](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/81),
  [`198eb66`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/198eb66a0d4b667eee879c6f1539090976aaeb54))

* docs: add ADR 001 documenting user confirmation pattern

Add Architecture Decision Record documenting the choice to use FastMCP Elicitation for
user confirmation on destructive operations.

Documents: - Context and problem statement - 4 options considered (pre-flight,
parameter, prompt, elicitation) - Decision rationale (MCP-native, industry best
practice) - Implementation pattern with code examples - Tool categorization by risk
level - Testing requirements - Consequences and validation criteria

Decision: Use FastMCP Elicitation (MCP native protocol)

Rationale: Standard protocol, strong safety guarantees, rich context,

excellent developer experience

- test: update purchase order and sales order deletion tests for elicitation

* Replace old deletion tests with elicitation pattern tests - Add imports for
  AcceptedElicitation, DeclinedElicitation, CancelledElicitation - Test all elicitation
  response paths (not found, accepted, declined, cancelled) - Align with product and
  supplier test patterns - All 276 tests passing

- test: implement autospec for service mocks to enforce interface compliance

Use create_autospec() for all service mocks in conftest.py to prevent tests from passing
while mocking non-existent methods. This ensures that test mocks always match the actual
service interfaces.

Benefits: - Tests will fail immediately if they mock non-existent methods - Prevents
bugs where tests pass but production code fails - Provides better refactoring safety -
Catches method name typos and signature mismatches

This change was implemented after discovering that tests were mocking
services.suppliers.list_suppliers() instead of list_all(), which allowed the bug to slip
through to the resource implementation.

All 276 tests pass with autospec enforcement.

Addresses: #82

- fix: add nullable enum support to client regeneration + fix resource bug

1. Add nullable enum field support to regeneration script - Add
   `add_nullable_to_enum_fields()` function - Mark OrderPlanFilterCriteria.currentStatus
   as nullable - Fixes "None is not a valid CurrentStatusEnum" errors - Addresses: #83

1. Fix supplier directory resource method name - Change `list_suppliers()` to
   `list_all()` - This bug was caught by autospec implementation - Related: #82

The regeneration script now handles enum fields that can be null in API responses, using
the allOf + nullable pattern for OpenAPI 3.0.

- fix: regenerate client with nullable currentStatus enum field

Regenerated Python client from StockTrim OpenAPI spec with the nullable enum field fix
applied. The currentStatus field in OrderPlanFilterCriteria can now handle null values
from the API.

Changes: - OrderPlanFilterCriteria.currentStatus is now CurrentStatusEnum | None | Unset
\- from_dict() properly handles None values without throwing validation errors

This fixes the "None is not a valid CurrentStatusEnum" error when querying order plan
data.

Fixes: #83

- fix: remove limit parameter from ProductService.list_all() calls

The ProductService.list_all() method doesn't accept a limit parameter, but foundation.py
was calling it with limit=50. This was caught when testing resources with MCP Inspector
at runtime.

Root cause: test_foundation.py was using mock_foundation_context which overrode the
autospec'd services from conftest.py with plain AsyncMock, so tests couldn't catch the
interface mismatch.

Changes: - foundation.py: Remove limit=50 from list_all() call, use slicing instead -
test_foundation.py: Remove mock_foundation_context fixture that was overriding
autospec'd services with plain AsyncMock - test_foundation.py: Update all tests to use
mock_context directly - test_foundation.py: Fix catalog limit test to verify slicing
behavior

This ensures autospec catches interface mismatches in resource tests.

- fix: use bulk endpoint for listing all suppliers

The Suppliers.get_all() method was incorrectly using /api/Suppliers endpoint without a
code parameter, which returns 404. The StockTrim API has separate endpoints for
different supplier operations: - /api/Suppliers?code=X - returns single supplier
(requires code) - /api/SuppliersBulk

- returns all suppliers (no parameters)

This is different from other endpoints like Customers and Products which return arrays
from their main endpoint.

Changes: - Import get_api_suppliers_bulk from generated API - Use bulk endpoint when
code is UNSET (listing all) - Use single endpoint when code is provided (get specific
supplier) - Update docstring to clarify the conditional behavior

This fixes the 404 error in the supplier directory MCP resource.

- **release**: Mcp v0.10.0
  ([`f1209d8`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/f1209d8479b03823bf7dff82288d9fc47ac61ba5))

### Documentation

- **mcp**: Comprehensive documentation enhancements and template externalization (#5)
  ([#78](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/78),
  [`d5ee08d`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/d5ee08d4666d41a5d228d05b67d01a5a62230955))

* test(mcp): add comprehensive tests for structured logging

Add test coverage for logging configuration and observability decorators.

Tests added: - test_logging_config.py (10 tests): * Configuration with different formats
(console, JSON) * Configuration with different log levels * Logger instance creation \*
Environment variable handling * Invalid configuration handling

- test_observability.py (15 tests): * @observe_tool decorator functionality \*
  @observe_service decorator functionality * Success and failure scenarios * Timing
  measurements * Parameter filtering * Function metadata preservation * Exception
  propagation

All 25 tests pass successfully.

This provides coverage for the structured logging implementation added in commit
925a19f.

- fix(test): replace time.sleep with asyncio.sleep in async tests

Address code review feedback: use asyncio.sleep() instead of time.sleep() in async test
functions to properly test timing without blocking the event loop.

Changes: - Replace time.sleep() with asyncio.sleep() in timing tests - Remove
AsyncMock() calls that don't yield control - Import asyncio instead of time module

Fixes PR review comments from Copilot.

- test: add comprehensive tests for forecast management tools

Add 13 new unit tests covering the two new forecast management workflow tools: -
forecasts_update_and_monitor (5 tests) - forecasts_get_for_products (8 tests)

Tests cover: - Trigger-only and wait-for-completion modes - Progress monitoring and
timeout handling

- Error scenarios and validation - Filtering, sorting, and priority indicators - Empty
  results and summary statistics

Also fix DTO field name issues in forecast_management.py: - Remove references to
non-existent supplier_name field - Use correct field names (order_quantity,
safety_stock_level) - Add pytest timeout marker for long-running test

All 235 tests now passing.

- fix: remove unused product_name assignment

Address Copilot review comment - remove unnecessary product_name assignment that was
immediately overwritten. Now correctly uses product_code as the display name since the
DTO doesn't have a product_description field.

"Common Use Cases" section - "Best Practices" section (where applicable) - Enhanced
examples with realistic data - "See Also" section with links to: * Complete workflows in
examples.md * Related tools * Foundation tools for comparison

This makes the tools self-documenting and provides clear guidance for AI agents on when
and how to use each tool.

- refactor: extract magic numbers to named constants

Address Copilot review comments by defining: - MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_BYTES = 400_000 -
ESTIMATED_CHARS_PER_FORECAST_ITEM = 500

This improves maintainability and makes token budget thresholds easy to adjust.

- fix: address Copilot review comments

* Extract priority threshold constants (HIGH=7, MEDIUM=14 days) - Remove unnecessary
  comments from test file - Fix markdown formatting for environment variables

* feat(mcp): implement Phase 3 MCP resources for discovery

Add 9 MCP resources that enable AI agents to explore StockTrim data without making tool
calls, improving context gathering and discovery.

Resources Implemented:

Foundation Resources (6): - stocktrim://products/{product_code} - Product details -
stocktrim://products/catalog - Product catalog (50 item limit) -
stocktrim://customers/{customer_code} - Customer details -
stocktrim://suppliers/{supplier_code} - Supplier information -
stocktrim://locations/{location_code} - Location details -
stocktrim://inventory/{location_code}/{product_code} - Stock levels

Report Resources (3): - stocktrim://reports/inventory-status?days_threshold=30 - Low
stock items - stocktrim://reports/urgent-orders - Items needing reorder (< 7 days) -
stocktrim://reports/supplier-directory - Supplier directory

Key Implementation Details: - All resources return JSON for LLM consumption - Proper
error handling with ResourceError for not found cases - Service layer reuse via
dependency injection - UNSET handling for optional API fields - Token budget management
(30-50 item limits on lists) - Client-side filtering for order plan queries (API
limitation) - Inventory resource uses product-level stock (no GET endpoint)

Testing: - 24 comprehensive unit tests for all resources - All 267 tests passing - Test
coverage for success cases, not found errors, and edge cases

Documentation: - Updated server.py instructions with resource documentation - Organized
into Foundation and Report categories - Examples of resource usage in common workflows

## v0.8.0 (2025-11-06)

### Bug Fixes

- Resolve all 40 test failures across service and tool layers
  ([#72](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/72),
  [`770d2b4`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/770d2b45a3359f2bd62c9a82938d352747613057))

This commit fixes all pre-existing test failures by properly implementing AsyncMock for
service layer methods and aligning test mocks with the actual service layer
architecture.

## Changes

### Service Layer Fixes (5 tests) - **customers.py**: Added NotFoundError exception handling to

return None instead of propagating the exception - **test_suppliers.py**: Fixed method
name calls from `list_suppliers()` to `list_all()`

### Purchase Orders Tool Fixes (15 tests) - **purchase_orders.py**: - Fixed status enum handling:

Changed from `.value` to `.name` for IntEnum - Added proper UNSET checks:
`if status not in (None,   UNSET)` instead of falsy checks (which fail for
status=0/DRAFT) - Added list vs single object handling for API responses - Added UNSET
import

- **test_purchase_orders.py**: - Updated fixture to mock `services.purchase_orders`
  instead of `client.purchase_orders` - Fixed all method names: `find_by_reference` →
  `get_by_reference`, `get_all` → `list_all` - Configured proper AsyncMock return values
  for delete operations - Added validation error mocking using `side_effect` - Fixed
  status expectations: "0" → "DRAFT"

### Urgent Orders Workflow Fixes (3 tests) - **urgent_orders.py**: Fixed status enum handling

(`.value` → `.name`) and added UNSET checks

### Workflow Tool Test Fixes (18 tests)

#### Forecast Management (7 tests) - Added `mock_forecast_context` fixture with AsyncMock for

products service and client - Updated all tests to use `services.products.get_by_code()`
and `services.client.products.create()` - Fixed string assertion for API limitation
message

#### Product Management (5 tests) - Added `mock_product_mgmt_context` fixture with AsyncMock -

Updated all tests to use proper service layer mocking - Converted all `mock_context`
references to use new fixture

#### Supplier Onboarding (7 tests) - Added `mock_supplier_onboarding_context` fixture with AsyncMock

for suppliers, products services and client - Updated method calls: `.create_one()` →
`.create()`, `.find_by_code()` → `.get_by_code()` - Fixed supplier_id expectations to
match implementation (string conversion of id field)

## Key Patterns Established

1. **AsyncMock Required**: All service layer methods require `AsyncMock()` not
   `MagicMock()` for proper await expression handling

1. **Service vs Client Layer**: Workflow tools use `services.X.method()` for reads but
   `services.client.X.create()` for complex updates

1. **IntEnum Status Handling**: Use `.name` not `.value` for string representation of
   IntEnum status fields

1. **UNSET Checks**: Check `if value not in (None, UNSET)` not just `if value` for
   fields that can legitimately be 0

## Test Results

- **Before**: 157/197 tests passing (40 failures) - **After**: 197/197 tests passing (0
  failures) ✅
  - **Coverage**: 79%

Implements comprehensive structured logging using structlog with automatic observability
for all MCP tools and service operations.

Features: - Structured logging with dual format support (console/JSON) -
Environment-based configuration (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT) - Automatic tool invocation
tracking with timing metrics - Service layer operation tracing at DEBUG level - Rich
error context with categorization - Comprehensive documentation with examples

Changes: - Add structlog dependency (>=24.1.0) - Create logging_config.py for structured
logging setup - Create observability.py with @observe_tool and @observe_service
decorators - Update server.py to use structured logging for lifecycle events - Apply
observability decorator to supplier tools - Add comprehensive logging documentation
(docs/mcp-server/logging.md)

Console format provides human-readable colored output for development. JSON format
provides machine-readable logs for production aggregation.

Example structured log events: - logging_configured: Logging system initialized -
server_starting/ready/shutdown: Server lifecycle - tool_invoked/completed/failed: Tool
execution tracking - service_operation_started/completed/failed: Service layer tracing

### Refactoring

- Align service layer patterns for consistency
  ([#68](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/68),
  [`8750df4`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/8750df421860d3933820662a43a763e55e230d05))

Standardizes patterns across all service layer implementations to ensure consistent
behavior and maintainability.

## Changes

**CustomerService:** - Change get_by_code() from try/except NotFoundError to truthy
check pattern - Remove unused NotFoundError import - Now consistent with Products,
Suppliers, and Purchase Orders services

**SupplierService:** - Rename list_suppliers() to list_all() for consistency - Fix
isinstance() logic to match other services (was inverted) - Update corresponding tool to
call list_all()

**SalesOrderService:** - Add existence check to delete_for_product() before deletion -
Return (False, message) if no orders found, matching delete pattern in other services -
Prevents unnecessary API calls for non-existent resources

**Context:** - Auto-sorted imports (ruff fix)

## Pattern Alignment

All services now follow these consistent patterns:

1. **Get Operations:** Truthy check for not-found (no exceptions) 2. **List
   Operations:** Consistent isinstance() handling for API quirks 3. **Delete
   Operations:** Existence check before deletion 4. **Method Naming:** list_all() for
   listing all entities 5. **Return Types:** Consistent across all services

## Testing - ✅ All 71 tests passing - ✅ Linting clean (ruff, mypy, yamllint) - ✅ No breaking changes

to tool interfaces

This improves code maintainability by ensuring all services follow the same patterns
established in the Products service (reference implementation).

refactor: migrate workflow tools to use service layer

Migrate all 4 workflow tools to use the service layer pattern instead of accessing the
client directly. This completes Issue #48 and aligns workflow tools with the established
service layer architecture.

## Changes

- **forecast_management.py**: Updated to use ProductService - **product_management.py**:
  Updated to use ProductService - **supplier_onboarding.py**: Updated to use
  SupplierService and ProductService
  - **urgent_orders.py**: Updated to use ProductService (order_plan/PO v2 remain on
    client)

## Implementation Notes

- All tools now use `get_services(context)` instead of accessing client directly -
  Complex operations (product updates with DTOs) use `services.client` when needed -
  Order plan and PO v2 operations still use client as they're not yet in service layer -
  All 71 tests pass - Removed unused SupplierRequestDto import from
  supplier_onboarding.py - Added missing `list_all()` method to ProductService -
  Replaced `services._client` with public `services.client` for proper encapsulation

## Impact

- Improved consistency across codebase - Better separation of concerns - Easier to test
  and maintain
  - Sets pattern for future workflow tools

* feat: migrate Purchase Orders tool to service layer pattern

This PR migrates the Purchase Orders tool to use the service layer pattern following the
Products service example from PR #51. The Purchase Orders tool is the most complex
foundation tool with 4 operations and extensive business logic.

## Changes

### New Service Layer - **services/purchase_orders.py**: New PurchaseOrderService class with: -

`get_by_reference()`: Get PO by reference number - `list_all()`: List all purchase
orders - `create()`: Create PO with line items, supplier, location, status - `delete()`:
Delete PO by reference number

### Updated Tool Layer - **tools/foundation/purchase_orders.py**: Refactored to thin wrappers - All

4 tool implementations now delegate to service methods - Removed direct client access -
Tools focus on request/response transformation only

### Server Integration - **context.py**: Added PurchaseOrderService to ServerContext - Initialized

alongside ProductService - Available to all tools via get_services()

## Key Highlights

- **Status Enum Handling**: Proper IntEnum parsing (DRAFT=0, APPROVED=1, etc.) - **Line
  Item Validation**: Ensures product_code, quantity, and validates > 0 - **Total Cost
  Calculation**: Computed from line items in tool layer - **UNSET Handling**: Proper use
  of UNSET sentinel for optional fields - **Error Handling**: Consistent validation and
  logging patterns

## Testing

- ✅ All 71 tests passing - ✅ Type checking passes (uv run poe lint) - ✅ Pre-commit hooks
  pass

feat(mcp): migrate suppliers tool to service layer pattern

Migrates the Suppliers tool to use the service layer pattern following the Products
service example from PR #51.

## Changes

### New Service Layer - Created `SupplierService` with methods: - `get_by_code()`: Get supplier by

code - `list_suppliers()`: List all suppliers - `create()`: Create new supplier -
`delete()`: Delete supplier by code

### Updated Tool Layer - Refactored suppliers tools to thin wrappers using `get_services()` - Fixed

field mapping to use correct DTO fields (supplier_code, supplier_name, email_address,
primary_contact_name) - Removed non-existent fields (phone, is_active) from SupplierInfo
model

### Server Integration - Updated ServerContext to include SupplierService - Updated

services/__init__.py to export SupplierService

### Testing - Added comprehensive test coverage (18 tests) - All tests passing, type checking clean,

linting passes

Closes #56 Part of #46

## v0.4.0 (2025-11-05)

### Bug Fixes

- Add type checking to pre-commit and fix purchase order type issues
  ([`17ff3dc`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/17ff3dcae73749a693f2f250bc9cdbabf5f2265b))

- Added purchase_order_request_dto.py and purchase_order_response_dto.py to type fix
  list - Added 'lint' hook to pre-commit to catch type errors before commit -
  Regenerated client with type fixes applied - All type checks now passing

This ensures ty check runs before every commit, preventing type errors from reaching CI.

- Update spec for DELETE 204 and integer status enum
  ([`e6bf963`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/e6bf963a23412418273452d51819d05a32685fb6))

## Summary

Fixed two critical spec/API mismatches discovered through testing:

1. DELETE /api/PurchaseOrders returns 204 (not 200) 2. PurchaseOrderStatusDto uses
   integers (not strings)

## Changes Made

### 1. DELETE Response Status Code - **Issue**: API updated to return 204 No Content, spec still

documented 200 OK - **Impact**: Client crashed expecting response data for 200 -
**Fix**: Updated spec DELETE /api/PurchaseOrders to expect 204 - **Automated**: Added
STEP 2.8 to regenerate_client.py

### 2. Purchase Order Status Enum Type - **Issue**: API returns integers (0,1,2,3), spec defined

strings ("Draft", etc.) - **Impact**: Client crashed with
`ValueError: 0 is not a valid   PurchaseOrderStatusDto` - **Fix**: Changed enum type to
integer with x-enum-varnames mapping - **Automated**: Added STEP 2.7 to
regenerate_client.py - **Result**: Generates IntEnum accepting API's integer values

### 3. Documentation - Added comprehensive sections to api-feedback.md documenting both issues -

Included DELETE endpoint status (PurchaseOrders fixed, others unknown) - Explained
x-enum-varnames positional mapping for future reference

## Testing - All 71 tests passing - Verified DELETE /api/PurchaseOrders returns 204 via API testing

- Verified DELETE /api/Products still returns 200 (5+ second delay) - Confirmed status
  enum handles integer values correctly

## Automation Both fixes now run automatically in regenerate_client.py: - STEP 2.7: Converts status

enum to integer with varnames - STEP 2.8: Updates DELETE /api/PurchaseOrders to 204

Addresses post-merge Copilot review comments on PR #51.

## Changes

### utils.py - Add detailed docstring explaining UNSET vs None semantics - Clarify that OpenAPI

client uses UNSET as sentinel value - Document why conversion to None is needed for
Pydantic models - Note: UNSET not imported here (only Unset class for type checking) but
shown in docstring example for user reference

### services/products.py - Expand comment explaining product_id and product_code_readable dual

assignment - Document the three key reasons for setting both fields to the same value:
1\. Users think of "code" as primary identifier 2. Ensures consistent IDs that match
user-facing code 3. Makes find_by_code() work reliably with either field - Add inline
comments distinguishing internal ID vs user-facing code

## Benefits - Better understanding of UNSET sentinel pattern - Clear rationale for seemingly

redundant field assignment - Improved maintainability through explicit documentation

## v0.3.0 (2025-11-04)

### Bug Fixes

- Use allOf pattern for nullable object references in OpenAPI spec
  ([`380d97d`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/380d97d95c6a6b6423a64ee40b2b481f9face92b))

The OpenAPI 3.0 spec ignores `nullable: true` when it appears alongside `$ref`. This
caused the code generator to produce buggy code for nullable object references like
PurchaseOrderResponseDto.location, which would crash when the API returned null.

Changes: - Updated regenerate_client.py to detect $ref fields and apply allOf pattern -
For object references: wraps $ref in allOf array and adds nullable: true - For
scalar/date fields: continues to use simple nullable: true - Regenerated client with
proper None handling for location field - Updated all documentation to reference the
allOf pattern

The generated code now correctly handles null object references: - Type annotation
includes | None - Parser function checks for None before calling .from_dict() - Tested
with real API data showing location: null

This fix only affects PurchaseOrderResponseDto.location, which is the only nullable
object reference in NULLABLE_FIELDS. All other fields are scalars.

  [`3ff95cd`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/3ff95cd3a14197de25a55babd7c9ab30b753c9be))

* feat: add support for purchase order upsert and nullable orderDate

This commit implements two key improvements to the StockTrim API client:

1. **Upsert Support for POST Endpoints** (STEP 2.6) - POST /api/PurchaseOrders now
   handles both 200 (update) and 201 (create) responses - POST /api/Products now handles
   both 200 (update) and 201 (create) responses - Uses client_reference_number as upsert
   key for purchase orders - Uses code as upsert key for products

1. **Nullable orderDate in PurchaseOrderRequestDto** - Made orderDate nullable to match
   response schema behavior - Allows proper handling of null order dates from API -
   Enables updates that preserve existing dates (using UNSET) - Documents API
   limitation: orderDate cannot be cleared once set

Changes to regeneration script: - Added STEP 2.6: add_200_response_to_upsert_endpoints()
\- Added PurchaseOrderRequestDto to NULLABLE_FIELDS configuration - Made orderDate,
externalId, referenceNumber, and location nullable

Documentation: - Added section on upsert pattern discovery and implementation -
Documented orderDate field asymmetric behavior (nullable in responses, required in
requests) - Provided workarounds for common use cases

Closes: API feedback improvements for purchase order management

- test: add comprehensive tests for purchase order upsert functionality

Add test suite for purchase order upsert behavior (create OR update): - Test POST
returns 201 for new purchase orders - Test POST returns 200 for updates (based on
clientReferenceNumber) - Test orderDate can be None (nullable) - Test orderDate can be
UNSET (omitted to preserve existing) - Test location can be None (nullable) - Test
status enum handles integer values from API

Fix PurchaseOrderStatusDto to handle integer status codes: - API returns integers
(0=Draft, 1=Approved, 2=Sent, 3=Received) - Added _missing_ classmethod to map integers
to enum values

Relates to #44

- fix: add explicit __aenter__/__aexit__ for proper type checking

Add explicit async context manager methods to StockTrimClient that return the correct
type (StockTrimClient instead of AuthenticatedClient).

This fixes type checker errors in consuming code where `async with client` would resolve
to AuthenticatedClient instead of StockTrimClient, causing type checkers to not
recognize the helper properties (products, purchase_orders_v2, etc.).

- feat(mcp): implement base service infrastructure (#43)

Create foundational service layer for MCP tools to eliminate code duplication and
improve maintainability.

## Changes

- Create `services/base.py` with BaseService class - Common validation helpers
  (validate_not_empty, validate_positive) - Base initialization pattern for all services
  \- Create `services/__init__.py` package initialization - Create `dependencies.py` with
  get_services() helper - Clean context extraction for tool functions - Update
  `server.py` ServerContext to support service layer - Added comments for future service
  instances

## Infrastructure

This establishes the foundation for: - ProductService (#45) - All foundation tool
services (#46) - Comprehensive unit testing (#47) - Workflow tool services (#48)

## Testing

- All new files pass ruff checks - No regressions in existing tests - Ready for service
  migration

Related: #42 (ADR), #45 (Products reference implementation)

- fix: add type guards for nullable location field parsing

Fix type checking errors in purchase order DTOs by adding explicit cast() calls when
parsing nullable location fields.

- Add `cast(dict, data)` in location field parsers to satisfy type checker - Add UNSET
  type guard in test to handle nullable order_date assertions - Ensures type safety
  while maintaining runtime behavior

## Type Errors Fixed

- `purchase_order_request_dto.py:252` - location parsing -
  `purchase_order_response_dto.py:279` - location parsing -
  `test_purchase_order_upsert.py:175-177` - order_date assertions

- **mcp**: Migrate products tool to service layer
  ([#51](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/51),
  [`eb2ad3c`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/eb2ad3c651d5a63a288db82d03e888657f52ae6e))

feat(mcp): migrate products tool to service layer with type safety improvements (#45)

Implements ProductService as the reference implementation for the service layer pattern,
establishing a cleaner architecture for the StockTrim MCP Server.

## Architecture Changes

### Service Layer Pattern - Created ProductService with four core methods: - get_by_code(code: str)

-> ProductsResponseDto | None - search(prefix: str) -> list[ProductsResponseDto] -
create(code, description, cost_price, selling_price) -> ProductsResponseDto -
delete(code: str) -> tuple[bool, str] - Created BaseService with common validation
helpers - Established dependency injection via get_services(context)

### Circular Import Resolution - Created context.py module for ServerContext - Moved ProductService

import to module level - Separated context initialization from server lifecycle
management - Updated dependencies.py to use context.ServerContext

### Code Quality Improvements - Refactored products tools to thin wrappers (~10-20 lines per

function) - Added comprehensive type annotations throughout - Replaced \*\*kwargs with
explicit optional parameters - Created utils.py with unset_to_none() helper for Pydantic
compatibility

## Code Reduction - Products tool: 410 → 246 lines (40% reduction, ~164 lines removed) - Eliminated

duplicate validation logic across all 4 product operations - Centralized error handling
in service layer

## Type Safety Enhancements - All service methods have explicit return type annotations - Optional

parameters use typed None defaults instead of \*\*kwargs - UNSET sentinel values
properly converted to None for Pydantic models - Module-level imports for better IDE and
static analysis support

## Bug Fixes - Fixed Pydantic validation errors in sales_orders when optional fields return UNSET -

Reduced sales_orders test failures from 10 to 6 - Overall test failures reduced from 13
to 11 - Remaining failures are pre-existing test bugs (confirmed on main branch)

## Testing - All 5 product management workflow tests pass - No new test failures introduced -

Products tool migration fully verified - CI: All checks passing (test, quality,
security)

## Benefits - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between tools and business logic -

**Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints improve IDE support and catch errors early -
**Testability**: Service layer can be tested independently of FastMCP framework -
**Consistency**: Establishes pattern for migrating remaining 6 foundation tools -
**Discoverability**: Explicit parameters make API more intuitive

## Next Steps This PR establishes the reference implementation for Issue #46, which will migrate the

remaining foundation tools (customers, suppliers, locations, sales_orders,
purchase_orders, inventory) following this proven pattern.

Expected additional code reduction: ~270-370 lines

Related: #42 (ADR), #43 (Base infrastructure), #46 (Remaining tools)

Refactored sales_orders, purchase_orders, and inventory tools to follow established
patterns from existing foundation tools (products, customers).

Key improvements:

**sales_orders.py:** - Removed redundant validation (Pydantic handles this) - Removed
excessive hasattr() checks - trust generated model schemas - Removed manual list/object
handling - helpers return proper types - Removed deleted_count field from
DeleteSalesOrdersResponse

**purchase_orders.py:** - Changed order_date from str to datetime type (better type
safety) - Removed redundant supplier_code validation - Removed message field from
CreatePurchaseOrderResponse - Simplified date handling (let Pydantic parse)

**inventory.py:** - Moved UNSET import to module level (consistency) - Changed error
handling: raise exceptions instead of success/failure model - Simplified InventoryResult
to only contain data (no success boolean)

**Documentation:** - Updated tools.md to reflect datetime type for purchase orders

Benefits: - Reduced code by ~55 lines - Better type safety with Pydantic validation -
Consistent patterns across all tools - More Pythonic error handling - Leverages helper
methods effectively

All tests passing, linting clean, formatting verified.

## v0.1.0 (2025-11-01)

### Bug Fixes

- Add nullable to date/time fields in OpenAPI spec post-processing
  ([`55721de`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/55721de60bfee53b52593155533b4bcb630bd39d))

Adds a new post-processing step to the regeneration script that ensures date/time and
scalar fields which can be null are properly marked as nullable in the OpenAPI spec
before code generation.

Changes: - Added add_nullable_to_date_fields() function to scripts/regenerate_client.py
\- Integrated as STEP 2.5 in the regeneration workflow (after auth fixes, before
validation) - Updated docs/contributing/api-feedback.md to reflect fix status -
Regenerated client with nullable fields properly handled

The StockTrim API returns null for many date/time fields (orderDate, fullyReceivedDate,
receivedDate, etc.) which previously caused TypeErrors when isoparse() tried to parse
None values. The generated code now includes proper null checks before parsing.

Tested: All 61 tests pass

  [`c7498fa`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/c7498fad639ce61496d71bd9f6f4e3cb8fee12e2))

* fix: disable Bearer token prefix to prevent malformed Authorization header

StockTrim uses custom auth headers (api-auth-id, api-auth-signature) instead of the
standard Authorization Bearer token. Passing prefix='' to the parent AuthenticatedClient
prevents it from adding 'Authorization: Bearer ' header.

Fixes 'Illegal header value b"Bearer "' error when connecting to StockTrim API.

- refactor: use AuthenticatedClient's native auth_header_name for api-auth-id

Improved StockTrim authentication to leverage AuthenticatedClient's built-in header
customization instead of workarounds:

- Set `auth_header_name="api-auth-id"` to use native header customization - Pass actual
  `api_auth_id` value as `token` parameter - Simplified AuthHeaderTransport to only
  handle `api-auth-signature` - Removed `api_auth_id` parameter from
  `create_resilient_transport()`

This approach is cleaner and more idiomatic than the previous solution that used an
empty token with an empty prefix. It leverages the generated client's built-in
capabilities while maintaining our custom transport for the signature header.

Benefits: - No malformed Authorization headers - Uses built-in mechanisms (cleaner, more
maintainable) - Clear separation: static header via client, dynamic header via transport
\- Less custom code to maintain

All tests pass (48/48).

Addresses Copilot reviewer feedback on PR #38. The `orderDate` field was marked as both
required and nullable, which is a contradiction. Fields that can be null cannot be
required per OpenAPI specification semantics.

Updated `add_nullable_to_date_fields()` to: - Mark fields as nullable: true (existing

- Use SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN to bypass branch protection in release workflow
  ([`f3c09e5`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/f3c09e5c818348df7bdc0e16ba0ec8f8559a6ff0))

The release workflow was failing because repository branch protection rules require all
changes to main go through pull requests. The semantic-release action needs to push
version bump commits directly to main.

Changes: - Updated checkout action to use SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
\- Updated python-semantic-release action to use SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN

This matches the pattern used in katana-openapi-client and allows the release automation
to bypass branch protection rules with a personal access token.

Note: The SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN secret must be configured in repository

settings with a personal access token that has repo permissions.

Switched from the deprecated 'toml' package to Python 3.11+'s built-in tomllib for
reading and tomli-w for writing TOML files. Also fixed the installation command to use
'uv pip install' instead of 'uv run pip install' to ensure the package is available in
the uv environment.

- **release**: Commit MCP version bumps and use modern GitHub Actions output
  ([`175a50d`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/175a50d93bd374d445daf596d2e74b93f7e25293))

Fixes two issues in the MCP server release process:

1. MCP version bumps are now committed to git before building, preventing duplicate
   version errors on PyPI. Previously the version was only updated locally during the
   build, so every release tried to publish the same version.

1. Replaced deprecated ::set-output command with modern $GITHUB_OUTPUT environment file
   syntax.

Changes: - Git commit added after MCP version bump (with proper bot credentials) - Push
MCP version commit before building - Updated Python script to use GITHUB_OUTPUT file
instead of ::set-output

This ensures each MCP server release gets a unique, incremented version number that's
tracked in git.

### Continuous Integration

- Add environment names back to distinguish dual-package publishing

Added environment names to help PyPI Trusted Publishers distinguish between the two
packages published from the same workflow:

- Client: environment 'pypi-client' - MCP Server: environment 'pypi-mcp'

This allows PyPI to properly configure separate trusted publishers for each package.

Updated all GitHub Actions workflows to use UV instead of Poetry:

**CI Workflow (ci.yml):** - Use astral-sh/setup-uv@v4 action - UV-based Python
installation and dependency management - Removed Poetry caching, using UV's built-in
cache - Added concurrency control to cancel redundant runs - Simplified dependency
installation

**Documentation Workflow (docs.yml):** - Migrated to UV for docs building and testing -
Cleaner, faster builds with UV caching

**Release Workflow (release.yml):** - Dual-package build support (client + MCP server) -
Separate PyPI publishing for both packages - UV-based builds with `uv build` and
`uv build --package` - Individual artifact uploads and publishing

**Security Workflow (security.yml):** - UV integration for dependency scanning - Use
`uv tool` for semgrep installation - Maintained Trivy and dependency review

**Benefits:** - ✅ Faster CI runs (UV is significantly faster than Poetry) - ✅ Simplified
workflows (less caching boilerplate) - ✅ Dual-package release support - ✅ Consistent
tooling across local dev and CI

Created comprehensive feedback document highlighting: - OpenAPI specification
improvements (security schemes, documentation) - Response type consistency issues -
Authentication documentation needs - Endpoint convention questions - Pagination, error
handling, and versioning clarifications

All feedback is framed constructively and positively, intended to help StockTrim
developers improve the API for all users.

The document includes: - Clear examples of current state vs. suggested improvements -
Benefits of each suggestion - Specific questions that need clarification - Tables
comparing inconsistent patterns across endpoints

This serves as a reference for: 1. Our own client library design decisions 2. Future
discussions with StockTrim team 3. Understanding API quirks we need to work around

Updates based on user input and OpenAPI spec analysis:

API Characteristics: - No pagination, no rate limiting (confirmed) - Custom auth:
api-auth-id (Tenant Id) + api-auth-signature (Tenant Name) - Mixed access patterns: some
lists, some by ID, bulk operations - Query parameter filtering (e.g., BOMs by
productId/componentId)

Decisions Made: - Create domain helpers for ALL StockTrim entities - MCP tools:
verify_connection, get_product, check_inventory, list_orders - Document dual model
architecture (internal + Square integration) - API is primarily resource-based with
limited list operations

Domain Model Documented: - Core: Products, Customers, Suppliers, Locations, Inventory,
BOMs - Orders: Sales Orders (with bulk/range ops), Purchase Orders (V2) - Operations:
Order Plan, Forecasting, Processing Status, Configuration - Integrations: Square, InFlow

Simplified transport layer for StockTrim (no pagination/rate limit handling)

  ([`f73e368`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/f73e368dd7076cb14644e8e53d50490832110fd8))

This commit implements major improvements to the client generation and adds domain
helper classes for easier API interaction:

**Authentication Fix:** - Modified regeneration script to convert StockTrim's auth
header parameters to proper OpenAPI securitySchemes - Removes api-auth-id and
api-auth-signature from all 39 endpoints (78 params total) - Adds proper security scheme
definition that will be handled by transport layer - Generated API methods no longer
require auth parameters

**Domain Helper Classes:** - Created helpers package with base class and domain-specific
helpers - Added helpers for: Products, Customers, Suppliers, Sales Orders, Purchase
Orders, Inventory, and Locations - Integrated helpers into StockTrimClient with
lazy-loaded properties - Helpers provide ergonomic CRUD operations wrapping generated
API methods

**Note:** Helper method signatures need refinement to match actual StockTrim API
conventions (some endpoints use different parameter names than initially assumed). Type
checking currently fails but infrastructure is in place.

Related to Commit 7 in migration plan.

- Add convenience methods to all domain helpers
  ([`fe54385`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/fe54385a2488e56561c61f38e10f2794f036e577))

Added convenience methods to all helper classes that provide: - Simpler, more ergonomic
interfaces for common operations - Better handling of API inconsistencies - Clearer
intent through well-named methods

**Products:** - find_by_code(code) - Find single product, returns None if not found -
search(prefix)

- Alias for get_all() with clearer search intent - exists(code) - Boolean check for
  product existence

**Customers:** - exists(code) - Boolean check for customer existence -
find_or_create(code, \*\*defaults) - Get or create pattern

**Suppliers:** - find_by_code(code) - Handles single|list API inconsistency -
create_one(supplier) - Wrapper for batch API accepting single item - exists(code) -
Boolean check for supplier existence

**SalesOrders:** - get_for_product(product_id) - Clearer alias for filtering -
delete_for_product(product_id) - Clearer alias for deletion

**PurchaseOrders:** - find_by_reference(ref) - Handles single|list API inconsistency -
exists(reference_number) - Boolean check for order existence

**Inventory:** - set_for_product(product_id, ...) - Simplified single-product setter

These methods will directly inform MCP tool design, making the API more accessible
through Claude's tool interface.

All quality checks pass ✅

- Add defensive guard for GITHUB_OUTPUT environment variable
  ([`32a3b05`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/32a3b05021de7f51072a9d49d5f8c02caab7b9b1))

Add null check for GITHUB_OUTPUT before writing to it, making the script more robust for
local testing scenarios.

While GITHUB_OUTPUT is always set in GitHub Actions workflows, this defensive check
follows best practices and prevents potential issues in non-standard environments.

- Add utils.py with response unwrapping and typed exceptions
  ([`a6f0fe5`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/a6f0fe576b809d0f8943a799578254e615fd1db8))

This commit adds a comprehensive utils module for handling StockTrim API responses with
typed exceptions and convenience functions.

**Exception Hierarchy**:

- `APIError` (base exception with status_code and problem_details) -
  `AuthenticationError` (401) - `PermissionError` (403) - `NotFoundError` (404) -
  `ValidationError` (400, 422) - `ServerError` (5xx)

All exceptions include: - Human-readable error message - HTTP status code - Optional
ProblemDetails object from API

**Response Unwrapping Functions**:

1. `unwrap(response, raise_on_error=True)`: - Main utility for handling API responses -
   Auto-raises typed exceptions on error status codes - Returns parsed data on success -
   Optional non-raising mode (returns None on error)

1. `is_success(response)`: - Check if response has 2xx status code

1. `is_error(response)`: - Check if response has 4xx/5xx status code

1. `get_error_message(response)`: - Extract error message from ProblemDetails or status
   code

**StockTrim Simplifications**:

- No `unwrap_data()` function - StockTrim doesn't wrap responses in `.data` arrays -
  Focused on ProblemDetails error format when available - Clean fallback to status code
  for generic errors

**Testing**:

- Comprehensive test coverage (28 tests) - Tests for all exception types - Tests for
  success/error detection - Tests for error message extraction - All tests pass with
  full type safety

**Integration**:

- All utilities exported from package root - Proper type hints with mypy compliance -
  Compatible with generated Response[T] types

Example usage: \`\`\`python from stocktrim_public_api_client import StockTrimClient,
unwrap from stocktrim_public_api_client.api.products import get_api_products

async with StockTrimClient() as client: response = await
get_api_products.asyncio_detailed(client=client) products = unwrap(response) # Raises on
error, returns parsed data \`\`\`

* feat: implement comprehensive logging with DEBUG, INFO, and ERROR levels

Implement the complete logging architecture as specified in the logging documentation,
providing detailed observability across all HTTP operations.

## Changes

### Enhanced ErrorLoggingTransport - Track request/response timing for all operations - Route

responses to appropriate log levels based on status code - Log all requests at DEBUG
level with sanitized headers (privacy-first) - Log 2xx responses at INFO (status +
timing) and DEBUG (body excerpts) - Log 4xx/5xx errors at ERROR level with full response
details - Add WARNING for null responses that may cause TypeErrors

### New Logging Methods - `_log_request()`: DEBUG-level request logging with auth header

sanitization - `_log_success_response()`: INFO + DEBUG logging for 2xx responses -
`_log_server_error()`: ERROR logging for 5xx responses - Updated `_log_client_error()`
and `_log_problem_details()` with timing

### Comprehensive Test Coverage - 13 new tests for ErrorLoggingTransport covering: - Request header

sanitization - Success response logging (INFO and DEBUG levels) - Null response warnings
\- List/dict response formatting - Client/server error logging - Status code routing
logic - DEBUG level gating

### Documentation - Added complete logging architecture specification - Updated implementation

status (all items complete) - Documented privacy-first approach and performance
considerations

## Benefits

1. **Debug NoneType errors faster**: See actual API responses (null vs []) 2. **Monitor
   all operations**: INFO level tracks all successful requests 3. **Catch server
   errors**: Log 5xx errors that survive retries 4. **Privacy-first**: Auth headers
   automatically excluded from logs 5. **Performance-aware**: Expensive DEBUG ops only
   run when enabled

## Testing

- All 61 tests pass (including 13 new logging tests) - Full CI pipeline passes (format,
  lint, type-check, tests, docs) - 82% code coverage for stocktrim_client.py

- fix: address Copilot review feedback on logging PR

1. Fix mock_request bug: Use MagicMock instead of calling fixture as method 2. Extract
   hardcoded 200 truncation as class constant RESPONSE_BODY_MAX_LENGTH 3. Fix
   documentation inconsistency: change 500 chars -> 200 chars to match code

All tests pass. Addresses Copilot review threads #1, #3, #4, #5.

- feat: make null response log level configurable

Add `null_response_log_level` parameter to ErrorLoggingTransport to allow configuring
the log level for null API responses. Default is DEBUG to reduce noise in production,
but can be set to WARNING for debugging or a custom TRACE level (5) for minimal logging.

This addresses Copilot review feedback #2 about null warnings being too noisy for
legitimate null endpoints.

Example usage: \`\`\`python # Less noisy (default) client = StockTrimClient() # null
responses logged at DEBUG

# More visible for debugging from stocktrim_public_api_client.stocktrim_client import

ErrorLoggingTransport transport =
ErrorLoggingTransport(null_response_log_level=logging.WARNING) client =
StockTrimClient(httpx_client=httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport))

# Minimal logging (custom TRACE level) transport = ErrorLoggingTransport(null_response_log_level=5)

````

* feat: add intelligent parsing error logging with null field detection

Enhance error logging to automatically identify and report null fields when TypeErrors, ValueErrors,
or other parsing errors occur during response parsing.

Key improvements: - Added `log_parsing_error()` method to ErrorLoggingTransport for intelligent
error inspection - For TypeErrors: Recursively scans response JSON to identify all null fields -
For other errors: Shows response excerpts for debugging context - Zero performance overhead - only
runs when errors actually occur - Removed configurable null_response_log_level parameter (no
longer needed) - Removed generic null response warnings (replaced by specific error logging)

Error logging now provides actionable debugging information: - Exact field paths to null values
(e.g., "orderDate", "supplier.supplierName") - Full error message and type - Response excerpts for
context - Works for TypeErrors, ValueErrors, AttributeErrors, and generic Exceptions

Example output when TypeError occurs: ``` ERROR TypeError during parsing for GET /api/PurchaseOrders
ERROR TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len() ERROR Found 3 null field(s) in response:
ERROR - orderDate ERROR - fullyReceivedDate ERROR - supplier.supplierName ```

The enhanced logging makes debugging null field issues significantly faster by immediately showing
which specific fields are null, eliminating the need to manually inspect responses or enable DEBUG
logging.

* feat: add actionable fix suggestions to parsing error logging

Enhance error logging to provide immediate, actionable guidance when TypeErrors and other parsing
errors occur. Instead of just showing which fields are null, the logging now tells developers
exactly how to fix the problem.

Key improvements: - Added "Possible fixes" section with 3 solution paths: 1. Add fields to
NULLABLE_FIELDS in regenerate_client.py (quickest fix) 2. Update OpenAPI spec to mark fields as
nullable (proper fix) 3. Handle nulls defensively in helper methods (workaround) - Included
documentation link to api-feedback.md#nullable-date-fields section - Updated docstring with
enhanced output example - Updated documentation to show new error format - Enhanced tests to
verify fix suggestions and doc links are present

Example enhanced output: ``` ERROR TypeError during parsing for GET /api/V2/PurchaseOrders ERROR
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len() ERROR Found 3 null field(s) in response: ERROR -
orderDate ERROR - fullyReceivedDate ERROR - supplier.supplierName ERROR ERROR Possible fixes:
ERROR 1. Add fields to NULLABLE_FIELDS in scripts/regenerate_client.py and regenerate ERROR 2.
Update OpenAPI spec to mark these fields as 'nullable: true' ERROR 3. Handle null values
defensively in helper methods ERROR ERROR See:
docs/contributing/api-feedback.md#nullable-date-fields-not-marked-in-spec ```

This eliminates the need for developers to ask maintainers or search through documentation - they
immediately know exactly what to do when errors occur.

* fix: address Copilot review feedback on comprehensive logging

Address all actionable review comments from Copilot:

**Correctness Fixes:** - Fix ellipsis logic to only append "..." when actually truncating (3
locations) - Fix test timing assertions to use regex patterns instead of fragile exact checks -
Update documentation log examples to remove "OK" suffix (matches actual implementation) - Change
"Current/Desired" section to "Previous/New" (feature is implemented, not planned)

**API Improvements:** - Make `error_logging_transport` public (remove underscore) - it's part of
helper API - Extract `MAX_NULL_FIELDS_TO_LOG = 20` as class constant for consistency - Improve
null response message: "null (JSON null)" is clearer than "parsed as None"

All tests passing (21/21).

* fix: complete ellipsis fixes in log_parsing_error method

Fix remaining unconditional ellipsis appends in log_parsing_error method. These were missed in the
previous commit but follow the same pattern - only append '...' when content actually exceeds
RESPONSE_BODY_MAX_LENGTH.

Addresses remaining Copilot review comments on lines 455, 460, 468.

* fix: correct documentation link anchor in parsing error logs

Update documentation link from non-existent anchor to correct section:
#nullable-date-fields-not-marked-in-spec → #nullable-arrays-vs-optional-fields

Addresses Copilot review comment on line 449.

* fix: correct API model field names for Phase 2B workflow tools

Fixed type errors by using correct field names from generated API models: - Changed supplier_id to
id in SupplierResponseDto usage - Removed is_active field from SupplierRequestDto (not in API) -
Added null checks before accessing error field in tests

* fix: correct API model field names in Phase 1 foundation tools

Fixed type errors in Phase 1 foundation tools by using correct field names: - locations.py: Changed
code/name/is_active to location_code/location_name - products.py: Changed
code/description/cost_price/selling_price to product_id/product_code_readable/name/cost/price

These errors existed on main but weren't caught by CI previously.

* fix: correct import paths and model names in Phase 1 tools

Fixed type errors in Phase 1 tools: - inventory.py: Changed client_types import from .generated to
direct import - suppliers.py: Changed SupplierDto to SupplierRequestDto with correct field names

* fix: remove unsupported category field from OrderPlanFilterCriteriaDto

Removed category parameter from filter criteria as it's not supported by the API model. Only
location_codes and supplier_codes are valid filter fields.

This error existed from Phase 2A but wasn't caught by CI previously.

* fix: exclude MCP server from ty type checking to avoid external dependency issues

Reverted the addition of MCP server paths to ty configuration. The MCP server imports fastmcp which
isn't resolved by ty, causing false positive unresolved-import errors that block CI.

The MCP server code is still checked by ruff and pytest, just not by ty.

* fix: exclude MCP server tests from main project test suite

Removed MCP server from pytest testpaths and coverage configuration. The MCP server is a separate
package and should be tested independently.

This fixes ModuleNotFoundError when running tests, as the MCP server package isn't installed in the
main project's test environment.

This commit implements several improvements to the client generation process:

1. **Enhanced Regeneration Script** (adapted from katana-openapi-client): - Added multi-validator
approach (openapi-spec-validator + Redocly CLI) - Implemented types.py → client_types.py rename
during generation - Added post-processing for import fixing (.types → .client_types) - Implemented
Union type modernization (Union[A, B] → A | B) - Added RST docstring formatting fixes - Integrated
ruff auto-fixes with --unsafe-fixes flag - Added streaming test output for validation - Structured
output with clear step-by-step logging

2. **Client Types Architecture**: - Moved types.py from generated/ to package root as
client_types.py - This matches the katana-openapi-client architecture - All generated files now
import from ..client_types instead of .types - Prevents name conflicts with Python built-in types
module

3. **Generated Code Updates**: - All 42 generated model files updated with correct imports - All 40
generated API endpoint files updated with correct imports - client.py updated to use client_types
- Removed generated/py.typed and generated/types.py

- Rewrite StockTrimClient with transport pattern architecture
([`ca3d561`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/ca3d5614beabefad0599fb4cba49f3c0ad0b1203))

This commit implements a complete rewrite of the StockTrimClient using the transport-layer pattern,
adapted from katana-openapi-client.

**Architecture Changes**:

1. **Client Inheritance** (Breaking Change): - Old: StockTrimClient wraps AuthenticatedClient
(access via `.client`) - New: StockTrimClient inherits from AuthenticatedClient (pass directly) -
API methods now receive client directly: `method(client=client)` instead of
`method(client=client.client)`

2. **Layered Transport Architecture**: - `AsyncHTTPTransport` (base HTTP layer) -
`AuthHeaderTransport` (adds api-auth-id, api-auth-signature headers) - `ErrorLoggingTransport`
(logs 4xx errors with ProblemDetails parsing) - `RetryTransport` (retry 5xx errors on idempotent
methods only)

3. **Custom Retry Class**: - `IdempotentOnlyRetry` - only retries GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE on 5xx -
No rate limiting (429) handling - StockTrim doesn't rate limit - Uses httpx-retries library with
exponential backoff

4. **Simplified vs Katana**: - ❌ No RateLimitAwareRetry - StockTrim doesn't have rate limits - ❌ No
PaginationTransport - StockTrim doesn't paginate - ✅ ErrorLoggingTransport - Better error
visibility - ✅ Basic retry on 5xx for idempotent methods only

**New Components**:

- `create_resilient_transport()` - Factory for layered transport composition - `IdempotentOnlyRetry`
- Custom retry class for safe 5xx retries - `ErrorLoggingTransport` - Detailed 4xx error logging
with ProblemDetails - `AuthHeaderTransport` - StockTrim custom auth header injection

**API Changes**:

```python # Old usage async with StockTrimClient() as client: response = await
some_api(client=client.client) # Need .client

# New usage async with StockTrimClient() as client: response = await some_api(client=client) # Pass
directly! ```

**Testing**:

- Updated all tests for new architecture - All tests pass (5/5) - All quality checks pass (ruff,
mypy, yamllint)

### Refactoring

- Rewrite helpers with correct API signatures
([`e9f615e`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/e9f615e5752e7c397198d1e860423764d3a3bdcf))

Completely rewrote all domain helper classes from scratch based on actual StockTrim API signatures
instead of assumptions from katana.

**Key Changes:** - Renamed `list()` to `get_all()` to avoid shadowing builtin `list` type - Fixed
all method signatures to match actual StockTrim API endpoints - Added proper type annotations
including union types where API is inconsistent - Documented API inconsistencies in docstrings
with "Note:" sections

**Helper Methods Now Correctly Match API:** - Products: get_all(code?, pageNo?) → array, create(dto)
→ single, delete(productId?) - Customers: get_all() → array, get(code) → single, update(dto) →
array - Suppliers: get_all(code?) → single|array, create([dto]) → array, delete(codeOrName) -
SalesOrders: get_all(productId?) → array, create(dto) → single, delete(productId?) -
PurchaseOrders: get_all(refNum?) → single|array, create(dto) → single, delete(refNum) → single -
Inventory: set(request) → single - Locations: get_all(code?) → single|array, create(dto) → single

**API Inconsistencies Documented:** - Some GET endpoints return single objects when filtered (should
return arrays) - Inventory POST returns PurchaseOrderResponseDto (incorrect response type) -
Suppliers POST accepts/returns arrays (batch operation)

All quality checks pass: ruff, mypy, pytest ✅

- Separate client and MCP releases with proper chaining
([#35](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/pull/35),
[`2ebe64f`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/2ebe64f56bae1be9e0590077d66014ac816f4adc))

Refactored release workflow to separate client and MCP releases with proper chaining. All Copilot
review feedback has been addressed and threads resolved.

- Split MCP version update into separate steps and add error handling
([`319cc34`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/319cc343fddc3037ce5ccab3e135b28975c41be2))

Addresses Copilot review feedback:

1. Split version update into separate steps: - "Update MCP server version" - runs Python script and
sets output - "Commit and push MCP version bump" - commits the changes - "Build MCP server
package" - builds the package This allows proper use of GitHub Actions outputs instead of parsing
stdout with grep (which is not portable due to -P flag).

2. Add error handling for git commit: - Use `git diff --cached --quiet ||` to only commit when
changes exist - Prevents workflow failures on re-runs or when version hasn't changed

### Testing

- Enhance test infrastructure with comprehensive fixtures
([`f9623e9`](https://github.com/dougborg/stocktrim-openapi-client/commit/f9623e9936f7572010af772e67109958f5ffb057))

Added comprehensive test fixtures following katana patterns:

**New Fixtures:** - async_stocktrim_client: Async context manager for testing -
create_mock_response: Factory for creating custom mock responses - mock_server_error_response: 500
error with ProblemDetails format - mock_authentication_error_response: 401 unauthorized response -
mock_validation_error_response: 422 with validation errors - mock_not_found_response: 404 response
- stocktrim_client_with_mock_transport: Client with mock transport

**Benefits:** - More flexible test response creation - Better error response mocking - Async client
testing support - Mock transport integration

All existing tests continue to pass (42 passed).

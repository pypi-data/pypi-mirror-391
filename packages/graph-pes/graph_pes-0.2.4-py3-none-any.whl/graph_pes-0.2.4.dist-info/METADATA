`graph-pes` is a framework built to accelerate the development of machine-learned potential energy surface (PES) models that act on graph representations of atomic structures.

## Features

- Experiment with new model architectures by inheriting from our `GraphPESModel` [base class](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/models/root.html).
- [Train your own](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/quickstart/implement-a-model.html) or existing model architectures (e.g., [SchNet](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/schnet.html), [NequIP](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/nequip.html), [PaiNN](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/pinn.html), [MACE](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/mace.html), [TensorNet](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/tensornet.html), etc.).
- Use and fine-tune foundation models via a unified interface: [MACE-MP0](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html), [MACE-OFF](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html), [MatterSim](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mattersim.html), [GO-MACE](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html) and [Orb v2/3](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/orb.html).
- Easily configure distributed training, learning rate scheduling, weights and biases logging, and other features using our `graph-pes-train` [command line interface](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/cli/graph-pes-train/root.html).
- Use our data-loading pipeline within your [own training loop](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/quickstart/custom-training-loop.html).
- Run molecular dynamics simulations with any `GraphPESModel` using [torch-sim](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/tools/torch-sim.html), [LAMMPS](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/tools/lammps.html) or [ASE](https://jla-gardner.github.io/graph-pes/tools/ase.html)

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -q graph-pes

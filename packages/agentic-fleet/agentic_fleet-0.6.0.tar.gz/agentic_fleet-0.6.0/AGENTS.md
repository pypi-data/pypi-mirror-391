# AgenticFleet Agents Documentation

## Overview

AgenticFleet ships a roster of specialized agents built atop Microsoft's agent-framework. Each agent focuses on a distinct stage of problem solving (research, analysis, composition, evaluation, iteration). The DSPy supervisor chooses which subset to engage and how (delegated, sequential, parallel, or handoff chains).

## Core Agents

### 🔍 Researcher

Purpose: High‑quality information gathering & source discovery.
Tools: `TavilyMCPTool`, `BrowserTool` (optional).
Strengths: Current events, citation generation, multi‑source synthesis.
Sample Tasks:

```text
"Who won the 2024 US presidential election?"
"Research latest transformer architecture improvements"
"Find pricing changes for Azure AI in Q3 2025"
```

Config (excerpt from `workflow_config.yaml`):

```yaml
agents:
  researcher:
    model: gpt-4o
    tools: [TavilySearchTool]
    temperature: 0.5
```

### 📊 Analyst

Purpose: Structured data, computation, code execution.
Tools: `HostedCodeInterpreterTool`.
Strengths: Statistical analysis, simulations, chart generation, validation of research claims.
Sample Tasks:

```text
"Compute year‑over‑year growth from this CSV"
"Run a Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment"
"Generate a bar chart of quarterly revenue"
```

Config:

```yaml
analyst:
  model: gpt-4o
  tools: [HostedCodeInterpreterTool]
  temperature: 0.3
```

### ✍️ Writer

Purpose: Narrative synthesis & formatted output.
Tools: None (language model only).
Strengths: Reports, documentation, blog posts, structured summaries.
Sample Tasks:

```text
"Draft an executive summary of research findings"
"Write a blog post on sustainable AI practices"
"Produce a README section describing evaluation pipeline"
```

Config:

```yaml
writer:
  model: gpt-4o
  temperature: 0.7
```

### 👀 Reviewer

Purpose: Quality gate, consistency & polish.
Tools: None.
Strengths: Style alignment, minor corrections, coherence checks.
Sample Tasks:

```text
"Review the draft report for clarity and tone"
"Check if instructions section covers all steps"
```

Config:

```yaml
reviewer:
  model: gpt-4o
  temperature: 0.4
```

### ⚖️ Judge

Purpose: Structured evaluation & scoring with dynamic criteria.
Tools: Internal reasoning (may leverage model reasoning effort flags).
Strengths: Criteria generation, gap detection, refinement directives.
Quality Threshold: Configurable (e.g. `judge_threshold: 7.0`).
Sample Evaluation Dimensions: correctness, completeness, clarity, citation quality (when applicable).

## Handoff Specialists

These roles participate in explicit multi‑stage production flows:

| Agent     | Role                                          | Highlights                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Planner   | Decompose task into ordered steps             | High reasoning effort; produces structured plan    |
| Executor  | Coordinate plan execution & progress tracking | Detects stalls; escalates blockers                 |
| Coder     | Implement technical changes / prototypes      | Low temperature; code interpreter access           |
| Verifier  | Validate artifacts & test improvements        | Regression detection & acceptance criteria checks  |
| Generator | Final user‑facing assembly                    | Integrates verified outputs into polished response |

Additions require updates to: `workflow_config.yaml`, `agents/*.py`, prompt modules, training examples, and tests.

## Execution Patterns

| Pattern       | Flow                                   | Example                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated     | Single agent                           | "Summarize latest AI conference keynote" → Researcher          |
| Sequential    | Linear chain                           | Researcher → Analyst → Writer → Reviewer                       |
| Parallel      | Concurrent specialists then synthesize | Researcher(AWS) + Researcher(Azure) + Researcher(GCP) → Writer |
| Handoff Chain | Explicit staged roles                  | Planner → Coder → Verifier → Generator                         |

Supervisor selects pattern based on task analysis + historical examples.

## Selection Guidelines

| Need                                    | Choose     | Rationale                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Current factual info                    | Researcher | Web search + citation tooling    |
| Computation / data transform            | Analyst    | Sandboxed code execution         |
| Narrative / documentation               | Writer     | Higher creativity temperature    |
| Final polish / consistency              | Reviewer   | Style & coherence adjustment     |
| Formal scoring / improvement directives | Judge      | Structured criteria & thresholds |

Combine agents when tasks span multiple domains (e.g. research + quantitative analysis + reporting).

## Tooling Matrix

| Tool                      | Provided By           | Purpose                 | Notes                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| TavilyMCPTool             | Researcher            | Web search w/ citations | Requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`              |
| BrowserTool               | Researcher (optional) | Direct page interaction | Install Playwright; respect robots.txt |
| HostedCodeInterpreterTool | Analyst, Coder        | Compute & visualize     | Sandboxed; no external network         |

Extending tooling: implement agent-framework `ToolProtocol`, register in `ToolRegistry`, reference in YAML.

## Adding a New Agent (Checklist)

1. Create `agents/new_role.py` with `get_config()`.
2. Add prompt instructions under `prompts/new_role.py`.
3. Register in `workflow_config.yaml` under `agents:`.
4. Update training examples (include tasks requiring new role).
5. Extend tests (routing + execution + quality) under `tests/`.
6. Document in `AGENTS.md` & link where relevant.
7. (Optional) Provide evaluation tasks exercising new role.

---

## Performance Tuning

- Lower temperature for deterministic roles (Analyst, Coder, Verifier).
- Use lighter model (gpt-5-mini) for supervisor to reduce latency.
- Limit `max_bootstrapped_demos` during prototyping; increase for production stability.
- Cache compilation; clear when signatures or examples change.
- Stream outputs (`enable_streaming: true`) for improved UX on long tasks.

## Troubleshooting Quick Hits

| Issue             | Likely Cause                   | Mitigation                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Weak routing      | Sparse or low-quality examples | Expand `supervisor_examples.json`           |
| Slow refinement   | High reasoning effort on Judge | Try `reasoning_effort: minimal`             |
| Missing citations | Tavily key absent              | Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`              |
| Tool not found    | Registry mismatch              | Confirm name & import in `ToolRegistry`     |
| Stalled chain     | Overly long agent roster       | Reduce agents or enable progress heuristics |

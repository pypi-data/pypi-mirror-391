           or a license that is compatible with GPL Version 2.0 or a later version,
           where "compatible" means that software provided under the Change License can

## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. It's 10-100x faster than pip and provides a unified toolchain.

**Install uv:**
```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or via pip/pipx
pip install uv
```

**Install Zephyr:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment and install
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install zephyr-py

# With performance optimizations
uv pip install zephyr-py[performance]

# With all dev tools
uv pip install zephyr-py[dev]
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install package
pip install zephyr-py

# With optional dependencies
pip install zephyr-py[performance]  # Performance optimizations
pip install zephyr-py[dev]          # Development tools
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Modern async/await support

## Quick Start

```python
from zephyr import Application
from zephyr.core import Router
from zephyr.security import JWT, RateLimiter
from zephyr.cache import RedisCache
from zephyr.db import Database

# Create application
app = Application("myapp")

# Configure components
app.use_jwt(JWT(secret_key="your-secret"))
app.use_rate_limit(RateLimiter(requests=100, window=60))
app.use_cache(RedisCache(url="redis://localhost"))
app.use_database(Database(url="postgresql://localhost/myapp"))

# Define routes
router = Router()

@router.get("/")
async def hello():
    return {"message": "Hello from Zephyr!"}

@router.post("/items")
@jwt_required
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return await item.save()

app.add_router(router)

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

## Visualizing Diagrams

The documentation includes Mermaid diagrams which can be viewed in several ways:

1. **VS Code**: 
   - Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
   - Open markdown file and press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to preview

2. **Mermaid Live Editor**:
   - Copy diagram code between ```mermaid tags
   - Paste at [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)

3. **Documentation Site**:
   - Run `mkdocs serve` in the project directory
   - Open http://localhost:8000

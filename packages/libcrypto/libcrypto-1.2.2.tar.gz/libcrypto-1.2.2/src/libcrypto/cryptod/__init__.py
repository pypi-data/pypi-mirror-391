Cryptod - Embedded Cryptographic Library

This package contains the embedded cryptographic primitives from PyCryptodome,
bundled locally to eliminate external dependencies.

Users can import from this package to access low-level cryptographic functions:
    from libcrypto.cryptod.lib.Crypto.Hash import SHA256
    from libcrypto.cryptod.lib.Crypto.Cipher import AES

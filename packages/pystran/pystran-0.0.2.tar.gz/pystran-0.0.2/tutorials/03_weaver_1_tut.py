# Weaver 3D frame benchmark

## Problem description:

This example is a 3D frame for which multiple independent solutions are
available in the open literature (hence, it is a benchmark).

Displacements, reactions, and internal forces are provided in the verification
manual.

A number of quantities can be checked against independent solutions. These
reactions are consistent with STAAD.Pro 2023.00.03 User Manual, assuming
Poisson ratio 0.25:

Joint 3:
   Rx=-1.1041, Ry=-0.43222, Rz=0.21731, Mx=48.785, My=-17.973, Mz=96.122:
Joint 4:
   Rx=-0.89588, Ry=1.4322, Rz=-0.21731, Mx=123.08, My=47.246, Mz=-11.72:

The internal forces can also be checked against the manual (but the number of
available digits in the manual is limited).

# Example of a three dimensional frame problem

## Problem description:

Frame with three legs that are clamped, loaded by a torque.

Displacements and internal forces are provided in the book, and we can check
our solution against these reference values.

Important note: Our orientation of the local coordinate system is such that web
of the H-beams is parallel to beam z axis! This is different from the
orientation in the book, where the web is parallel to the y axis.

## References

This example is completely solved in the book Matrix Analysis of Structures by
Robert E. Sennett, ISBN 978-1577661436 (Section 6.4).

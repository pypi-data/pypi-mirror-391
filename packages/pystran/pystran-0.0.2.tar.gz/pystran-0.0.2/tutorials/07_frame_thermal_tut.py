# Example of a two-dimensional frame problem with thermal gradient loading

## Problem description:

Frame with two legs. The top is loaded with a thermal gradient through the depth
of the beam.

Displacements and internal forces are provided in the book, and we can check our
solution against these reference values.

## References

This example is completely solved in the book Matrix Analysis of Structures by
Robert E. Sennett, ISBN 978-1577661436 (Example 3.5).

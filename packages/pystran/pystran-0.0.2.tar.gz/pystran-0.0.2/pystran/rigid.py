def rigid_link_stiffness(e_x, h, Gamma):
    r"""
    Compute rigid link stiffness matrix.

    The stiffness matrix is computed as

    .. math::
        K =\begin{bmatrix} 
            C^T\Gamma C & -C^T\Gamma  \\
            -\Gamma C & \Gamma \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
    

    Here :math:`C` is a matrix computed from the vector  :math:`r = h e_x`, 
    which is the difference between the location of 
    the subordinate and the location of the master.

    In three dimensions
    
    .. math::
        C =\begin{bmatrix} 
            1 & \widetilde{r} \\
            0 & 1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
    
    Here :math:` \widetilde{r}` is a skew matrix corresponding to the 
    vector :math:`r`, and :math:`0` and :math:`1` stand for :math:`3\times3` zero 
    and identity matrices respectively.

    Further, :math:`\Gamma` is a diagonal matrix, such that 
    the diagonal entries provide penalty on the difference 
    between the individual degrees of freedom.

# Using `pystran` with Spyder

The easiest way to run a `pystran` example is to download and install [Spyder
6](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). It is a complete IDE for Python,
including a very capable debugger. Just open an example and click the run
button.

The detailed instructions are as follows:

Create new project in Spyder.

Create the project from an "existing" folder, i.e. `pystran` top folder.

Make sure the project pane is showing.

Then start a console in the folder where your script is located.

Open a tutorial.

Run the tutorial by clicking the green arrow button.
Or, debug the tutorial by clicking the button with the blue arrow and two vertical bars (run-and-pause).

## Plotting

By default the IDE will display the plots in the graphics pane.
The plots are then static -- they cannot be interacted with.

If that is not what we want, we should change the graphics settings as

![set graphics settings](graphics_settings.png)

That will open interactive windows for all the plots outside of the editor.

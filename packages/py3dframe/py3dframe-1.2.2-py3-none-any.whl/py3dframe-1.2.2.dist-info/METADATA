# py3dframe

## Description

`py3dframe` provides tools to create, manipulate and query **orthogonal,
right‑handed 3‑D frames of reference**.  

All input arrays are automatically converted to `numpy.float64` so that
every calculation is performed in double‑precision, guaranteeing numerical
stability throughout the library.

## Installation

Install with pip

```
pip install py3dframe
```

```

Clone with git

```
git clone https://github.com/Artezaru/py3dframe.git
```

## Usage

This section will guide you through the basic usage of the `py3dframe` package.

### Construct a right-handed frame

To create a frame, you can provide the origin and the axes of the frame as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from py3dframe import Frame

origin = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x_axis = np.array([1, 0, 0])
y_axis = np.array([0, 1, 0])
z_axis = np.array([0, 0, 1])

frame = Frame.from_axes(origin=origin, x_axis=x_axis, y_axis=y_axis, z_axis=z_axis)
```

You can also construct a frame from a rotation and a translation using one of the 8 possible conventions:

| Index | Formula |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | **Xe** = **R** ⋅ **Xf** + **T** |
| 1 | **Xe** = **R** ⋅ **Xf** − **T** |
| 2 | **Xe** = **R** (**Xf** + **T**) |
| 3 | **Xe** = **R** (**Xf** − **T**) |
| 4 | **Xf** = **R** ⋅ **Xe** + **T** |
| 5 | **Xf** = **R** ⋅ **Xe** − **T** |
| 6 | **Xf** = **R** (**Xe** + **T**) |
| 7 | **Xf** = **R** (**Xe** − **T**) |

Where **Xe** is the point expressed in the parent (or global) frame E, **Xf** is the point expressed in the child (or local) frame F, **R** is the rotation matrix and **T** is the translation vector.

```python
from py3dframe import Frame, Rotation

rotation = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [0, 0, 0], degrees=True)
translation = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(3, 1)

frame = Frame.from_rotation(translation=translation, rotation=rotation, convention=0)
```

### Construct a system of frames

Let’s consider a person walking in a train.
The person is represented by a frame F and the train is represented by a frame E.
It is possible to represent the position of the person in the train by defining the frame F in the frame E coordinates.

![System of frames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Artezaru/py3dframe/master/py3dframe/resources/train_person_frame.png)

```python
from py3dframe import Frame, FrameTransform

rotation = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [0, 0, 0], degrees=True)
translation = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(3, 1)

frame_E = Frame.from_rotation(translation=translation, rotation=rotation, convention=0)

rotation = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [0, 0, 0], degrees=True)
translation = np.array([0, 0, 0]).reshape(3, 1)

frame_F = Frame.from_rotation(translation=translation, rotation=rotation, convention=0, parent=frame_E)
```

In this case, when the frame E moves, the frame F moves with it.

### Transformation between frames

The transformation between two frames can be computed using the `FrameTransform` class:

```python
from py3dframe import Frame, FrameTransform

rotation = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [0, 0, 0], degrees=True)
translation = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(3, 1)

frame_E = Frame.from_rotation(translation=translation, rotation=rotation, convention=0)

rotation = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [0, 0, 0], degrees=True)
translation = np.array([0, 0, 0]).reshape(3, 1)

frame_F = Frame.from_rotation(translation=translation, rotation=rotation, convention=0, parent=frame_E)

transform = FrameTransform(input_frame=frame_E, output_frame=frame_F)

print(transform.translation)
print(transform.rotation.as_euler('xyz', degrees=True))
```

This object can be used to transform points or vectors from one frame to another:

```python
point_E = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(3, 1)
point_F = transform.transform(point=point_E) # In convention 0: pE = R * pF + T
point_E = transform.inverse_transform(point=point_F)

vector_E = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(3, 1)
vector_F = transform.transform(vector=vector_E) # In convention 0: vE = R * vF
vector_E = transform.inverse_transform(vector=vector_F)
```

When the frame E moves, the `transform` object will automatically update the transformation between the two frames.

# Main Sequence Python SDK



The **Main Sequence Python SDK** is a powerful set of client libraries designed to facilitate interaction with Main Sequence systems using Python. 

**We strongly** encourage you to go through our examples. 
We have built the examples as individual Jupyter notebooks that explain the SDK through use cases. 
Since most platform usage involves a combination of operations, this is the most intuitive way to learn about Main Sequence.

## 1. Abstract
ScaleNet introduces a chained multi-FOV convolutional architecture enabling high-resolution predictions with large effective receptive fields. Lower-resolution UNet outputs feed into higher-resolution UNet bottlenecks to integrate contextual information efficiently. Validated on FIBSEM data from the CellMap Segmentation Challenge, ScaleNet improves segmentation accuracy compared to single UNet baselines. Additionally, we present *LeibNetz*, a composable, Node-based graph framework for transparent and modular CNN construction in PyTorch. Both contributions aim to enhance reproducibility and scalability in bioimaging and beyond.

## 2. Introduction
- Motivation: large 3D microscopy volumes require both high spatial resolution and wide context, challenging for standard UNets due to FOV–memory tradeoffs.
- Problem: existing multi-scale or patch-based methods introduce artifacts or obscure input–output dimensional consistency.
- Contributions:
  1. **ScaleNet**: chained UNet architecture capturing multi-scale context efficiently.
  2. **LeibNetz**: composable framework ensuring explicit shape propagation and modular design.
  3. Open-source PyTorch implementation validated on FIBSEM segmentation tasks.

## 1. Abstract
ScaleNet introduces a novel chained multi-field-of-view (FOV) fully convolutional architecture that enables high-resolution predictions with large effective receptive fields by feeding lower-resolution UNet outputs into higher-resolution UNet bottlenecks. This hierarchical approach efficiently integrates contextual information across scales while maintaining memory efficiency for 3D bioimage analysis. Validated on CellMap Segmentation Challenge datasets containing focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIBSEM) organelle segmentation tasks, ScaleNet robustly predicts objects at high resolution even when their defining features lie outside the high-resolution FOV, addressing critical limitations of single-resolution UNet architectures. Additionally, we present *LeibNetz*, a composable, Node-based graph framework for transparent and modular CNN construction in PyTorch that ensures explicit shape propagation and eliminates the common problem of determining valid input/output dimensions in deep networks. Both contributions aim to enhance reproducibility and scalability in bioimaging applications and provide a foundation for future multi-scale architectures.

**Placeholder Results:**
- Robust high-resolution prediction for objects with defining features outside high-res FOV
- Successful segmentation where single-resolution UNets fail due to insufficient context
- Comparable inference time to single-resolution models with significantly improved accuracy

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Motivation and Problem Statement
**Topic Sentence:** Large 3D microscopy volumes present a fundamental challenge requiring both high spatial resolution for fine structural details and wide contextual fields-of-view for accurate segmentation, creating a memory-resolution tradeoff that standard UNet architectures cannot effectively resolve.

**Key Paragraphs:**
- Modern bioimage analysis increasingly relies on ultra-high resolution 3D datasets (e.g., FIBSEM volumes at nanometer resolution) that can span hundreds of micrometers, creating volumes that exceed GPU memory when processed at full resolution.
- Traditional solutions either sacrifice resolution through downsampling, losing critical fine details, or use patch-based approaches that introduce tiling artifacts and lose global context.
- The need for valid convolutions to prevent boundary artifacts in large-volume inference further constrains the effective receptive field, limiting context integration.

### 2.2 Contributions
**Topic Sentence:** This work addresses these limitations through two complementary contributions: a memory-efficient multi-scale architecture and a framework for transparent neural network construction.

1. **ScaleNet Architecture:** A chained UNet system where lower-resolution networks capture broad context and feed their outputs into the bottlenecks of higher-resolution networks, enabling large effective receptive fields without prohibitive memory costs.

2. **LeibNetz Framework:** A composable Node-based system that provides explicit shape propagation, automatic dimension tracking, and modular design principles for reproducible neural network construction.

3. **Open-Source Implementation:** Complete PyTorch implementation with validation on real bioimage segmentation tasks, demonstrating practical applicability and reproducibility.

## 4. Methods

### 4.1 Overview of ScaleNet Architecture
**Topic Sentence:** ScaleNet implements a hierarchical chain of UNet architectures operating at progressively decreasing field-of-view and increasing spatial resolution, with lower-resolution outputs directly feeding into higher-resolution bottlenecks.

**Key Technical Details:**
- Coarse-to-fine processing pipeline with explicit scale coupling
- Bottleneck injection mechanism for cross-scale feature integration
- Optional attention gating for selective feature propagation

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Let S_i be the i-th scale subnet with resolution r_i and FOV f_i
where r_1 < r_2 < ... < r_n and f_1 > f_2 > ... > f_n

Output: y_i = S_i(x_i, B_i(y_{i-1}))
where B_i is the bottleneck injection function
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install happymath
```

**Note**: When installing with pip, the ipopt solver is not included by default, and LightGBM models cannot be properly installed, which may cause AutoML errors. If you install via pip, it is recommended to manually install these two packages through conda.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- All dependencies are automatically installed

## Quick Start

### AutoML Example

```python
from happymath import AutoML
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
X, y = data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target']

# Automated classification
automl = AutoML.ClassificationML()
model = automl.fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Decision Analysis Example

```python
from happymath import Decision
import numpy as np

# Decision matrix and criteria types
dm_data = np.array([[250, 16, 12], [200, 16, 8], [300, 32, 16]])
criteria = ['min', 'max', 'max']

# Calculate weights and rankings
weighting = Decision.ObjWeighting()
weights = weighting.decide(dataset=dm_data, criterion_type=criteria).get_weights()

scoring = Decision.ScoringDecision()
rankings = scoring.decide(dataset=dm_data, weights=weights, criterion_type=criteria).get_rankings()
print(rankings)
```

### Differential Equations Example

```python
from happymath import DiffEq
import numpy as np

# Define ODE system
def ode_func(t, y):
    return -y + np.sin(t)

# Solve ODE
solver = DiffEq.ODE()
result = solver.solve(ode_func, t_span=[0, 10], y0=[1.0])
t, y = result.get_solution()
```

### Optimization Example

```python
from happymath import Opt
import numpy as np

# Define optimization problem
def objective(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2

# Solve optimization problem
optimizer = Opt.Optimization()
result = optimizer.minimize(objective, x0=[1.0, 1.0])
optimal_x = result.x
optimal_value = result.fun
```

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

- PostgreSQL with the Absurd extension installed
- Psycopg3 library for PostgreSQL connectivity

### Install from PyPI
```bash
pip install absurd
```

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodmena-limited/python-absurd-client.git
cd python-absurd-client
pip install .
```

### Development Installation
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the core functionality:

```python
import psycopg
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient

# Create a client instance
client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="my_queue")

# Connect to your PostgreSQL database
with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    # Create the queue (optional - done automatically when spawning tasks)
    client.create_queue(conn)
    
    # Spawn a new task
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="process_data",
        params={"input": "data"},
        headers={"priority": "high", "region": "us-east-1"},
        retry_strategy={
            "kind": "exponential",
            "base_seconds": 30,
            "factor": 2.0,
            "max_seconds": 3600
        },
        max_attempts=3,
        cancellation={
            "max_delay": 3600,      # Max 1 hour delay before starting
            "max_duration": 7200    # Max 2 hours total execution time
        }
    )

    print(f"Spawned task: {task_id}, run: {run_id}, workflow run: {workflow_run_id}")

    # Claim and process tasks
    claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn, qty=1, claim_timeout=60)
    for task_data in claimed_tasks:
        run_id, task_id, attempt, task_name, params, retry_strategy, max_attempts, headers, *_ = task_data

        try:
            # Process the task
            result = process_task(task_name, params)

            # Mark as completed
            client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
            print(f"Task {task_id} completed successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            # Mark as failed
            client.fail_task(conn, run_id, str(e))
            print(f"Task {task_id} failed: {e}")
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Processing

```python
import psycopg
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient

def process_task(task_name, params):
    """Simulate task processing"""
    if task_name == "echo":
        return {"output": f"Processed: {params.get('message', '')}", "status": "success"}
    return {"result": "unknown", "status": "error"}

# Create client
client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="default_queue")

# Connect to database and process tasks
with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    # Spawn a task
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="echo",
        params={"message": "Hello, World!"}
    )

    print(f"Spawned task: {task_id}")

    # Claim and process tasks
    claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn, qty=1)
    for task_data in claimed_tasks:
        run_id, task_id, attempt, task_name, params, *_ = task_data

        try:
            result = process_task(task_name, params)
            client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
            print(f"Completed task {task_id}")
        except Exception as e:
            client.fail_task(conn, run_id, str(e))
            print(f"Failed task {task_id}: {e}")
```

### Task Management

The client provides comprehensive task management capabilities:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="task_queue")

with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    # Spawn a task
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="complex_task",
        params={"data": "value", "options": {"verbose": True}}
    )

    # Get detailed task status
    task_status = client.get_task_status(conn, task_id)
    print(f"Task state: {task_status['state']}")
    
    # Get detailed run status
    run_status = client.get_run_status(conn, run_id)
    print(f"Run state: {run_status['state']}")
    
    # Schedule the task for future execution
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    future_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=10)
    client.schedule_task(conn, run_id, future_time)
    
    # Cancel a task if needed
    # client.cancel_task(conn, run_id)  # Only works if task is pending or sleeping
```

### Event Handling

Use events for cross-workflow coordination:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient, AbsurdSleepError

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="event_queue")

def task_that_waits_for_event(conn, run_id, task_id):
    """A task that waits for an event"""
    try:
        payload = client.wait_for_event(
            conn=conn,
            run_id=run_id,
            event_name="data_ready",
            timeout_seconds=3600,  # 1 hour timeout
            task_id=task_id,
            step_name="waiting_step"
        )
        return {"status": "received", "payload": payload}
    except AbsurdSleepError:
        # This is expected - the orchestrator should handle this
        # by marking the task as sleeping
        raise

def task_that_emits_event(conn):
    """A task that processes data and emits an event"""
    # Simulate data processing
    result = {"processed_data": "some_value"}

    # Emit the event that other tasks are waiting for
    client.emit_event(
        conn=conn,
        event_name="data_ready",
        payload=result
    )

    return {"status": "event_emitted", "data": result}

# In a real orchestrator, you would handle AbsurdSleepError like this:
def process_task_with_event_handling(conn, run_id, task_id):
    try:
        return task_that_waits_for_event(conn, run_id, task_id)
    except AbsurdSleepError as e:
        # Mark the run as sleeping until the event occurs
        client.set_run_sleeping(conn, e.run_id, e.event_name)
        # Return without completing the task - it will resume when event occurs
        return None
```

### Checkpoint Management

For long-running tasks that need to save state:

```python
import time
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="long_running_queue")

def long_running_task(conn, run_id, task_id):
    """Simulate a long-running task with checkpoints"""
    # Check if we have a checkpoint from a previous attempt
    checkpoint = client.get_checkpoint(conn, task_id, "progress")

    start_step = 1
    if checkpoint and checkpoint.get("state"):
        start_step = checkpoint["state"].get("current_step", 1)

    for step in range(start_step, 6):  # 5 steps total
        # Simulate work
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate processing

        # Save checkpoint
        client.set_checkpoint(
            conn=conn,
            task_id=task_id,
            step_name="progress",
            state={"current_step": step, "completed": f"step_{step}"},
            owner_run=run_id
        )

        # Extend claim if needed for long operations
        client.extend_claim(conn, run_id, extend_by_seconds=60)

    return {"status": "completed", "steps": 5}

with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    # Spawn the long-running task
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="long_running_task",
        params={"work": "complex_job"}
    )

    # Claim and process
    claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn)
    for task_data in claimed_tasks:
        run_id, task_id, *_ = task_data
        try:
            result = long_running_task(conn, run_id, task_id)
            client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
        except Exception as e:
            client.fail_task(conn, run_id, str(e))
```

### Workflow Tracking

Track complex workflows across multiple tasks:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient
import uuid
from datetime import datetime

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="workflow_tracking_queue")

def run_data_pipeline():
    with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
        # Create a workflow run to track this pipeline
        workflow_run_id = client.create_workflow_run(
            conn=conn,
            workflow_name="data_pipeline",
            workflow_version="1.0.0",
            inputs={"source": "s3://bucket/data", "target": "warehouse"},
            created_by="pipeline_system",
            tags={"environment": "production", "priority": "high"}
        )

        # Update workflow status
        client.update_workflow_run_status(
            conn=conn,
            workflow_run_id=workflow_run_id,
            status="running",
            started_at=datetime.now()
        )

        # Spawn the extraction task
        extract_task_id, extract_run_id, _ = client.spawn_task(
            conn=conn,
            task_name="extract_data",
            params={"workflow_run_id": workflow_run_id, "source": "s3://bucket/data"},
            headers={"workflow_run_id": str(workflow_run_id)}
        )

        # Process tasks (in real app, this would be a separate worker loop)
        claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn)
        for task_data in claimed_tasks:
            run_id, task_id, attempt, task_name, params, *_ = task_data
            
            try:
                # Simulate processing
                result = {"processed": f"Data from {params.get('source')}"}
                
                # Complete the task
                client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
                
                # Update workflow status when needed
                client.update_workflow_run_status(
                    conn=conn,
                    workflow_run_id=workflow_run_id,
                    status="completed",
                    result=result,
                    completed_at=datetime.now(),
                    task_count=1
                )
            except Exception as e:
                client.fail_task(conn, run_id, str(e))
                
                # Update workflow status to failed
                client.update_workflow_run_status(
                    conn=conn,
                    workflow_run_id=workflow_run_id,
                    status="failed",
                    error={
                        "type": "ProcessingError",
                        "message": str(e),
                        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
                    }
                )

run_data_pipeline()
```

### Connection Management

For production applications, use connection pooling:

```python
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient
import psycopg

# Create a connection pool
pool = ConnectionPool("your_connection_string", min_size=2, max_size=10)

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="pooled_queue")

def process_task_with_pooling():
    with pool.connection() as conn:
        # Spawn a task
        task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
            conn=conn,
            task_name="pooled_task",
            params={"data": "value"}
        )

        # Process any claimed tasks
        claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn, qty=5)
        for task_data in claimed_tasks:
            run_id, task_id, attempt, task_name, params, *_ = task_data

            try:
                result = {"processed": params}
                client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
            except Exception as e:
                client.fail_task(conn, run_id, str(e))

# Example with context manager for safety
def process_task_safely():
    try:
        with pool.connection() as conn:
            task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
                conn=conn,
                task_name="safe_task",
                params={"data": "value"}
            )
            # Process the task...
    except psycopg.OperationalError as e:
        print(f"Database connection error: {e}")
    except psycopg.Error as e:
        print(f"PostgreSQL error: {e}")
```

### Retry Strategies

Handle failures with configurable retry strategies:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient, spawn_retry_task

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="retry_queue")

def unreliable_task():
    """A task that sometimes fails"""
    import random
    if random.random() < 0.7:  # 70% chance of failure
        raise Exception("Random failure for demonstration")
    return {"status": "success"}

with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    # Spawn with retry strategy using convenience function
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = spawn_retry_task(
        client=client,
        conn=conn,
        task_name="unreliable_task",
        params={},
        max_attempts=5,
        retry_kind="exponential",
        base_seconds=10,
        factor=2.0,
        max_seconds=3600  # Max 1 hour between retries
    )

    # Or spawn directly with retry strategy
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="another_unreliable_task",
        params={},
        max_attempts=3,
        retry_strategy={
            "kind": "fixed",
            "base_seconds": 60  # Fixed 1 minute between retries
        }
    )

    # Process the task
    claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn)
    for task_data in claimed_tasks:
        run_id, task_id, *_ = task_data

        try:
            result = unreliable_task()
            client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
        except Exception as e:
            # The retry logic is handled by Absurd
            client.fail_task(conn, run_id, str(e))
```

### Cancellation Rules

Create tasks with automatic cancellation:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient, spawn_cancellable_task

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="cancellable_queue")

with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    # Spawn a task that can be cancelled if it takes too long
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = spawn_cancellable_task(
        client=client,
        conn=conn,
        task_name="potentially_long_task",
        params={"data": "value"},
        max_delay_seconds=3600,      # Max 1 hour of delay before starting
        max_duration_seconds=7200    # Max 2 hours total duration
    )

    # Or spawn directly with cancellation rules
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="another_long_task",
        params={"data": "value"},
        cancellation={
            "max_delay": 1800,      # Max 30 minutes of delay
            "max_duration": 3600    # Max 1 hour total execution time
        }
    )

    # Manually cancel a task if needed
    # client.cancel_task(conn, run_id)  # Only works for pending/sleeping tasks
```

### Long-Running Tasks

For tasks that need to extend their processing time:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient
import time

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="long_task_queue")

def long_processing_task(conn, run_id, task_id):
    """A task that extends its claim as needed"""
    for i in range(10):  # 10 steps of processing
        time.sleep(10)  # Simulate work
        
        # Extend the claim by 60 seconds for each chunk of work
        client.extend_claim(conn, run_id, extend_by_seconds=60)
        
        # Save progress checkpoint
        client.set_checkpoint(
            conn=conn,
            task_id=task_id,
            step_name="progress",
            state={"step": i, "total": 10},
            owner_run=run_id
        )
    
    return {"status": "completed", "steps": 10}

with psycopg.connect("your_connection_string") as conn:
    task_id, run_id, workflow_run_id = client.spawn_task(
        conn=conn,
        task_name="long_processing",
        params={}
    )
    
    claimed_tasks = client.claim_task(conn)
    for task_data in claimed_tasks:
        run_id, task_id, *_ = task_data
        result = long_processing_task(conn, run_id, task_id)
        client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
```

## Error Handling

The client includes comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:

### AbsurdSleepError
The `AbsurdSleepError` is a special exception that signals when a run enters SLEEPING state to wait for an event:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient, AbsurdSleepError

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="error_handling_queue")

try:
    payload = client.wait_for_event(
        conn=conn,
        run_id=run_id,
        event_name="data_ready",
        timeout_seconds=3600,
        task_id=task_id,
        step_name="waiting_step"
    )
except AbsurdSleepError as e:
    # The orchestrator should catch this and mark the run as sleeping
    print(f"Run {e.run_id} sleeping, waiting for event '{e.event_name}'")
    # In a real orchestrator, this would mark the run as sleeping
    # and free the worker thread to process other tasks

# In the orchestrator, you would typically handle it like this:
def handle_task_processing():
    try:
        # Process task here
        pass
    except AbsurdSleepError as e:
        # Mark the run as sleeping
        client.set_run_sleeping(conn, e.run_id, e.event_name)
        # Free worker thread - return from function without completing task
        return
```

### Database Errors
The client handles database errors appropriately:

```python
from absurd_client import AbsurdClient

client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="my_queue")

try:
    # Attempt to complete a task
    client.complete_task(conn, run_id, result)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle database errors or other issues
    print(f"Failed to complete task: {e}")
    # Handle appropriately based on your application needs
```

### Validation Errors
Queue names are validated to prevent SQL injection:

```python
try:
    # This will raise ValueError if queue_name is invalid
    client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="invalid-queue-name!")  # Invalid character
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid queue name: {e}")

# Valid queue names contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
# and must start with a letter or underscore
client = AbsurdClient(queue_name="valid_queue_name")  # Valid
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The client supports the following environment variables:

- `ABSURD_DEFAULT_QUEUE`: Default queue name when not specified (default: `absurd_default`)
- `ABSURD_WORKER_ID`: Default worker ID (default: `absurd_worker_1`)

### Queue Name Validation
Queue names must follow these rules to prevent SQL injection:
- Must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Should not be overly long (recommendation: under 30 characters)

## Highway DSL Integration

The [highway-dsl](https://github.com/rodmena-limited/highway_dsl) package is a Python-based domain-specific language for defining complex workflows that fully supports Absurd. Highway DSL provides a fluent API for building workflows with features such as:

- **Rich Operators**: Task, Condition (if/else), Parallel, ForEach, While, Wait, Switch, EmitEvent, and WaitForEvent operators
- **Scheduling**: Built-in support for cron-based schedules, start dates, and catchup configuration
- **Event-Driven Features**: First-class support for event emission and waiting for cross-workflow coordination
- **Error Handling**: Retry policies, timeout policies, and callback hooks for production-grade workflows
- **YAML/JSON Interoperability**: Workflows can be defined in Python and exported to YAML or JSON
- **Mermaid Diagram Generation**: Visualize workflows with generated Mermaid diagrams

Example of defining a workflow with Highway DSL:

```python
from highway_dsl import WorkflowBuilder, RetryPolicy
from datetime import timedelta

# Create a complex ETL workflow
workflow = (
    WorkflowBuilder("data_pipeline")
    .set_schedule("0 2 * * *")  # Daily at 2 AM
    .set_start_date(datetime.now())
    .add_tags("etl", "production")
    .set_max_active_runs(1)
    .set_default_retry_policy(RetryPolicy(
        max_retries=3,
        delay=timedelta(seconds=30),
        backoff_factor=2.0
    ))
    .task("extract", "etl.extract_data", result_key="raw_data")
    .task("transform", "etl.transform_data", args=["{{raw_data}}"], result_key="transformed_data")
    .parallel("process_branches", {
        "branch_a": lambda w: w.task("process_a", "etl.process_part_a", args=["{{transformed_data}}"]),
        "branch_b": lambda w: w.task("process_b", "etl.process_part_b", args=["{{transformed_data}}"])
    })
    .task("load", "etl.load_data", args=["{{transformed_data}}"])
    .build()
)

# Export to YAML for use with Absurd
print(workflow.to_yaml())

# Generate Mermaid diagram
print(workflow.to_mermaid())
```

With highway-dsl, you can define complex workflow patterns using a clear, fluent syntax and export them in formats compatible with Absurd's PostgreSQL-based workflow engine.

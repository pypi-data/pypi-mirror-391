    """
    Perform a single-step inference without maintaining task state.

    This is useful for one-off analyses where you don't need to maintain
    a conversation or task context across multiple steps.

    Args:
        task_description: Description of the task to perform
        screenshot: Screenshot as Image, bytes, or file path
        instruction: Optional additional instruction for the task
        api_key: OAGI API key (uses environment variable if not provided)
        base_url: OAGI base URL (uses environment variable if not provided)
        temperature: Sampling temperature (0.0-2.0) for LLM inference

    Returns:
        Step: Object containing reasoning, actions, and completion status

    Example:
        >>> # Using with bytes
        >>> with open("screenshot.png", "rb") as f:
        ...     image_bytes = f.read()
        >>> step = single_step(
        ...     task_description="Click the submit button",
        ...     screenshot=image_bytes
        ... )

        >>> # Using with file path
        >>> step = single_step(
        ...     task_description="Fill in the form",
        ...     screenshot=Path("screenshot.png"),
        ...     instruction="Use test@example.com for email"
        ... )

        >>> # Using with Image object
        >>> from oagi.types import Image
        >>> image = Image(...)
        >>> step = single_step(
        ...     task_description="Navigate to settings",

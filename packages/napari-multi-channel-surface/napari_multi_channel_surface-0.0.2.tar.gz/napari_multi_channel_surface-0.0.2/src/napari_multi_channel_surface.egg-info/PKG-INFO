A [napari] plugin to enable easy interaction with multi-channel surfaces

----------------------------------

## Overview

The goal of this plugin is to provide a means for reading, writing, and interacting with surfaces containing
multiple color channels in [napari]. When reading, color channel data is imported into the `napari.layers.Surface` metadata dictionary under the key `'point_data'`. 
Different channels can be used to color the surface in [napari] using the `Channel Select` widget supplied with this plugin. 
Multi-channel surfaces are saved using the `point_data` metadata key to save each named channel.

Visualization of single channel vertex data is made possible in [napari] through the `vertex_values` Surface Layer property,
while the `vertex_colors` property enables RGB and RGBA representations.
Surface file formats such as `'.vtu'` provide the option of storing a variable number of features recorded at each vertex, 
and `napari-multi-channel-surface` provides functionality to utilise data in these formats.

## Installation

### In napari
This plugin was developed for use in the [napari] app. To install the plugin, go to

`Plugins` > `Install/Uninstall Plugins...`

Type `napari-multi-channel-surface` in the search box and click install next to the
entry `napari-multi-channel-surface` in the search results.

### With pip

You can install `napari-multi-channel-surface` via [pip]:

```
pip install napari-multi-channel-surface
```

If napari is not already installed, you can install `napari-multi-channel-surface` with napari and Qt via:

```
pip install "napari-multi-channel-surface[all]"
```


To install latest development version :

```
pip install git+https://github.com/judithlutton/napari-multi-channel-surface.git
```

## Usage

### Reading and writing
Reading and writing mesh files can be performed in [napari] using the read and save functions in the `File` menu.

#### File formats

`napari-multi-channel-surface` uses [meshio] to read and write mesh files, and supports files with the following extensions:
```
['.ply', '.vtk', '.vtu', '.xdmf', '.xmf', '.h5m', '.avs', '.e', '.exo', '.ex2', '.hmf', '.med', '.dat', '.tec']
```
This subset of file types supported by [meshio] can store color channel data.

### Channel Select Widget
You can use the `Channel Select` widget with any data loaded with `napari-multi-channel-surface`. Simply load the surface(s) and open the widget with

`Plugins` > `Channel Select (Multi Channel Surface)`

The widget allows you to select the surface you wish to interact with, (`Surface` dropdown) and and which channel you wish to view (`Channel` dropdown).

### Helpful hints for using the widget:
* If your channels have widely varying ranges, set auto-contrast to `continuous`
* Popular choices of colormaps include `viridis`, `plasma`, and `turbo`.

# OneMod

**OneMod** is an orchestration package that allows users to build pipelines of
various models created by [IHME Math Sciences](https://github.com/ihmeuw-msca).
Core features of **OneMod** include an intuitive syntax for defining the
dataflow between pipeline stages, the ability to easily parallelize over
different data subsets and/or parameter sets, and options for data validation.
Advanced users can also define their own custom stages.

For instructions on how to install and use OneMod, please refer to the
[documentation](https://ihmeuw-msca.github.io/OneMod/).

            Scrolls the given scrollable element until an element identified by strategy and selector becomes visible. This function returns immediately if the destination element is already visible in the view port. Otherwise it would scroll to the very beginning of the scrollable control and tries to reach the destination element by scrolling its parent to the end step by step. The scroll direction (vertical or horizontal) is detected automatically.

        Supported arguments:
            elementId (string): The identifier of the scrollable element. It is required that this element is a valid scrollable container and was located using the -android uiautomator strategy. If not provided, the first currently available scrollable view is selected for the interaction. Optional. Example: 123456-3456-3435-3453453
            strategy (string): The lookup strategy to use. Supported values: accessibility id (UiSelector().description), class name (UiSelector().className), -android uiautomator (UiSelector). Required. Example: 'accessibility id'
            selector (string): The corresponding lookup value for the selected strategy. Required. Example: 'com.mycompany:id/table'
            maxSwipes (number): The maximum number of swipes to perform on the target scrollable view in order to reach the destination element. If unset, it will be retrieved from the scrollable element itself via getMaxSearchSwipes() property. Optional. Example: 10

Usage of this gesture is recommended as a possible workaround for cases where the "native" tap call fails, even though tap coordinates seem correct. This issue is related to the fact these calls use the legacy UIAutomator-based calls while this extension is based on the same foundation as W3C does.

            x: The x-offset coordinate
            y: The y-offset coordinate
            locator: The map containing strategy and selector items to make it possible to click dynamic elements.

This manual step is only necessary if you prefer not to restart the emulator during session startup.

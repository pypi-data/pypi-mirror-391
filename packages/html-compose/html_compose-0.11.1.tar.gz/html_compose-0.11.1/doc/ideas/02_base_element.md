# Base Element

The base element has tricks built into it so that you can write HTML faster.

## Concepts

### [] Syntax for Children

`[]` syntax is a wrapper for `Element.append` i.e. `div().append`, except that it returns itself so that it can be chained: `div[ div["a", "b", "c"] ]`

Under the hood, this is just `BaseElement.__getitem__`

### [] Syntax Constructor

Normally you would construct an element like `h1()["My header"]`.

You can also do `h1["My header"]`.

You will notice this bypasses running the constructor.

Under the hood, this is just `BaseElement.__class_getitem__` which just runs the constructor with no parameters.
This shorthand can save a few keystrokes.

### Iterators / Callables

You can nest iterators and even place callables in your children. i.e. `div()[lambda: "evaluated at render time", [ br(), "text" ]]`

### Lambda Parameters

multi-parameter lambda function: `div()[lambda node, parent_if_avail: "Demo"]`
- 0 params: nothing
- param 1: parent node, if applicable \* param 2: its parent, if applicable

Element attributes aren't currently intended to be accessed to prevent mistreating HTML as data or application state, so these parameters likely be more useful in a custom extension of an element.

### Attribute Classes

You can access `Element`.`attribute` i.e. `img.srcset()` with description, implemented as classes which are chldren of subclass.
These can be passed in element initialization `a(attrs=[a.href("https://google.com")])` and has the benefit of auto-complete.

### LRU Cache

- The basic attribute concatenation functions are called a lot and so they maintain an LRU cache configurable in size via `Element`.`ATTR_CACHE_SIZE` i.e. `div.ATTR_CACHE_SIZE`. This works because it can guarantee it is only working on strings.
- The multi-parameter lambda function also has an LRU cache to reduce time spent getting function parameters.

### Name Conflicts

Examples:

- `class_`
- `del_`

You can't use `class` as an argument in Python because it is a keyword. We opt to call it `class_`

This alternative was chosen because it is identical to autocomplete.

The same rule is applied anywhere else a name conflicts with a keyword i.e. the `del` element.

### Repeat Attributes

In the event `class` or `style` occur multiple times, they are concatenated with the correct delimiter in the order they're received.

Because there's no clear way to concat other attributes, an exception is raised.

### XSS Prevention / Automatic Escape

Unescaped child nodes i.e. strings are automatically escaped to prevent XSS.

This is done by the PalletsProjects `markupsafe` library.

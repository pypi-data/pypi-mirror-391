# Code Generator

Idea: What if your editor had built-in hinting around HTML properties?

## Implementation

We take information from the HTML spec living document and MDN.

We place generated code in a separated directory, keeping magic out of the code.

the `tools` directory contains:

- The spec generator `spec_generator.py`
  - Pull, parse, and dump json we think is interesting
- The attribute code generator `generate_attributes.py`
  - Put that interesting information in generated class attributes using our
    formula defined in previous specs. If an attribute is a keyword or
    restricted by Python, append `_` to the end of the name so autocomplete
    works. Dump those in `src/html_compose/attributes`
- The element code generator `generate_elements.py`

  - Same deal as for attributes. Dump in src/html_compose/elements.

- `tools/generated/*.py` is the intermediate directory so runs do not write to
  the source control directory, but you can see when a new change has happened.

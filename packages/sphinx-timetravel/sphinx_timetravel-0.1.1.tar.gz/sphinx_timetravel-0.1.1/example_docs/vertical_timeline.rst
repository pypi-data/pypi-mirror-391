Styling and Layout
------------------

The vertical timeline automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.
On mobile devices, events appear in a single column for better readability.

By default, the timeline uses:

- A gradient blue line as the central axis
- Alternating left/right layout on desktop
- Single column layout on mobile
- Smooth hover animations
- Responsive typography

You can customize these styles by adding your own CSS or modifying the ``timeline.css`` file.

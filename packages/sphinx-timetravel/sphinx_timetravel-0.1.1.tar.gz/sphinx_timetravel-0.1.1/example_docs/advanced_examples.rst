Best Practices
--------------

Tips for creating effective timelines:

1. **Keep events concise**: Use brief titles with descriptions in separate lines
2. **Consistent dating**: Use ISO format (YYYY-MM-MM) for clarity
3. **Appropriate layout**: Use vertical for detailed history, horizontal for big-picture views
4. **Balance content**: Mix short and long descriptions for visual variety
5. **Relevant timeframes**: Choose start/end years that encompass your events
6. **Group related events**: Consider breaking very long timelines into multiple sections
7. **Use meaningful dates**: Avoid events too close together on horizontal timelines


Common Patterns
---------------

**Quarterly Reviews**

Use month-level precision to show quarterly milestones:

.. timeline::

   2024-01 Q1 Objectives
   ~~~
   Set quarterly goals.

   2024-04 Q2 Objectives
   ~~~
   Mid-year adjustments.

   2024-07 Q3 Objectives
   ~~~
   Planning for Q4.

   2024-10 Q4 Objectives
   ~~~
   Year-end priorities.


**Milestone-Focused**

Highlight major achievements:

.. timeline::

   2020 MVP Launch
   ~~~
   Minimum viable product released.

   2022 10K Users
   ~~~
   Reached 10,000 active users.

   2024 100K Users
   ~~~
   Reached 100,000 active users.


**Event-Based**

Document sequential events:

.. timeline::

   2024-01-15 Event A
   ~~~
   First major event.

   2024-06-20 Event B
   ~~~
   Second event.

   2024-12-01 Event C
   ~~~
   Final event.

===============
"browser" \| "crawler" = "brozzler"

Brozzler is a distributed web crawler (爬虫) that uses a real browser (Chrome
or Chromium) to fetch pages and embedded URLs and to extract links. It employs
`yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>`_ (formerly youtube-dl) to enhance
media capture capabilities and `rethinkdb
<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb>`_ to manage crawl state.

Brozzler is designed to work in conjunction with `warcprox
<https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox>`_ for web archiving.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.9 or later
- RethinkDB deployment
- Chromium or Google Chrome >= version 64

Note: The browser requires a graphical environment to run. When brozzler is run
on a server, this may require deploying some additional infrastructure,
typically X11. Xvnc4 and Xvfb are X11 variants that are suitable for use on a
server, because they don't display anything to a physical screen. The `vagrant
configuration <vagrant/>`_ in the brozzler repository has an example setup
using Xvnc4. (When last tested, chromium on Xvfb did not support screenshots,
so Xvnc4 is preferred at this time.)

Getting Started
---------------

The simplest way to get started with Brozzler is to use the ``brozzle-page``
command-line utility to pass in a single URL to crawl. You can also add a new
job defined with a YAML file (see `job-const.rst`) and start a local Brozzler
worker for a more complex crawl.

Mac instructions:

::

    # install and start rethinkdb
    brew install rethinkdb
    # no brew? try rethinkdb's installer: https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/osx/
    rethinkdb &>>rethinkdb.log &

    # optional: create a virtualenv
    python -m venv .venv

    # install brozzler with rethinkdb extra
    pip install brozzler[rethinkdb]

    # crawl a single site
    brozzle-page https://example.org

    # or enqueue a job and start brozzler-worker
    brozzler-new-job job1.yml
    brozzler-worker

At this point Brozzler will start archiving your site.

*Running Brozzler locally in this manner demonstrates the full Brozzler
archival crawling workflow, but does not take advantage of Brozzler's
distributed nature.*

Installation and Usage
----------------------

To install brozzler only::

    pip install brozzler  # in a virtualenv if desired

Launch one or more workers: [*]_ ::

    brozzler-worker --warcprox-auto

Submit jobs::

    brozzler-new-job myjob.yaml

Submit sites not tied to a job::

    brozzler-new-site --time-limit=600 https://example.org/

.. [*] A note about ``--warcprox-auto``: this option tells brozzler to
   look for a healthy warcprox instance in the `rethinkdb service registry
   <https://github.com/internetarchive/doublethink#service-registry>`_. For
   this to work you need to have at least one instance of warcprox running,
   with the ``--rethinkdb-services-url`` option pointing to the same rethinkdb
   services table that brozzler is using. Using ``--warcprox-auto`` is
   recommended for clustered deployments.

Job Configuration
-----------------

Brozzler jobs are defined using YAML files. Options may be specified either at
the top-level or on individual seeds. At least one seed URL must be specified,
however everything else is optional. For details, see `<job-conf.rst>`_.

::

    id: myjob
    time_limit: 60 # seconds
    ignore_robots: false
    warcprox_meta: null
    metadata: {}
    seeds:
      - url: https://one.example.org/
      - url: https://two.example.org/
        time_limit: 30
      - url: https://three.example.org/
        time_limit: 10
        ignore_robots: true
        scope:
          surt: https://(org,example,

Brozzler Dashboard
------------------

Brozzler comes with a rudimentary web application for viewing crawl job status.
To install the brozzler with dependencies required to run this app, run

::

    pip install brozzler[dashboard]


To start the app, run

::

    brozzler-dashboard

At this point Brozzler Dashboard will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/.

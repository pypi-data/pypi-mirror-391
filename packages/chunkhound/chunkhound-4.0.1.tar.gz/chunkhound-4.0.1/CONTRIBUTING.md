# Contributing to ChunkHound

Welcome to ChunkHound! We're excited you're interested in contributing to a **100% AI-generated codebase**.

## Our Mission: No Compromise on Quality

ChunkHound maintains a **100% AI-generated codebase** without compromising on production quality. Why? Because it's the only way to push forward AI-assisted development technology and truly eat our own dog food. Every line of code, documentation, and feature has been generated by AI agents working with human guidance.

Read our [origin story](https://chunkhound.github.io/origin-story/) to see how ChunkHound bootstrapped itself from an empty repository to a functional POC in a single day.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install and Set Up ChunkHound

Follow the [Tutorial](https://chunkhound.github.io/tutorial/) to:
- Install ChunkHound with `uv`
- Configure your embedding provider (OpenAI, VoyageAI, or Ollama)
- Index ChunkHound's own codebase
- Set up MCP integration with your AI agent

### 2. Use Code Research

Use ChunkHound's built-in [Code Research](https://chunkhound.github.io/code-research) tool to analyze the codebase architecture before making any changes. This tool helps your agent understand existing patterns and identify the minimal changes needed.

## Development Workflow

### Before Writing Any Code

**Always use Code Research first:**

```
Research the codebase. Consider the surrounding code style, architecture, and module responsibilities.
Think of the minimal required changes that reuse as much as possible.
```

This ensures your agent:
- Understands existing patterns and conventions
- Reuses existing mechanisms instead of duplicating code
- Follows the established architecture
- Makes minimal, targeted changes

### Quality Standards

1. **Match existing patterns** - Study how similar features are implemented
2. **Minimize changes** - Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
3. **Reuse mechanisms** - Don't reinvent existing functionality
4. **Test thoroughly** - Always run smoke tests before commits:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v
   ```
5. **AI-generated only** - All code must be generated by AI agents

### Testing Philosophy

ChunkHound's testing approach is designed for a 100% AI-generated codebase:

1. **Smoke tests are mandatory** - Always run before commits (`uv run pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v`)
   - Primary safety guardrail against AI-introduced breaking changes
   - Catch import-time crashes and type annotation bugs in ~10 seconds

2. **Real components over mocks** - Exercise actual functionality whenever possible
   - Use real file systems, temporary directories, actual components
   - Only mock external services when absolutely necessary
   - **Tests must pass 100% on all platforms** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

3. **Fast feedback over coverage** - Prioritize immediate failure detection
   - Better fewer reliable tests than many flaky ones
   - Clear error messages to guide AI corrections

4. **Tests as AI guardrails** - Define expected behavior to guide AI agents
   - Write failing tests first to specify requirements
   - Tests serve as safety nets during AI-driven development

## Dependency Management

ChunkHound uses a multi-layered dependency management strategy to ensure both library compatibility and reproducible deployments:

### Files and Their Purpose

1. **`pyproject.toml`** - Library dependencies with flexible constraints
   ```toml
   dependencies = [
       "duckdb>=1.4.0",  # Allows patch updates for compatibility
       "openai>=1.0.0",  # Flexible for downstream users
   ]
   ```
   - Uses `>=` constraints for published library
   - Prevents version conflicts for users
   - Modified only when adding/removing dependencies

2. **`uv.lock`** - Exact development environment
   - Contains precise versions of all dependencies
   - Generated by `uv lock` and `uv sync`
   - Committed to ensure reproducible development
   - Updated when dependencies change

3. **`requirements-lock.txt`** - Production deployment versions
   - Contains exact versions for production installs
   - Generated by `uv pip compile pyproject.toml --all-extras -o requirements-lock.txt`
   - Updated automatically during release preparation
   - Ensures reproducible production deployments

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Add a new dependency
uv add "new-package>=1.0.0"

# Update all dependencies
uv lock --upgrade

# Install exact development environment
uv sync

# Generate production lock file (done automatically by prepare_release.sh)
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --all-extras -o requirements-lock.txt
```

### Release Process

The `scripts/prepare_release.sh` script automatically:
1. Regenerates `requirements-lock.txt` with exact versions
2. Ensures all lock files are synchronized
3. Creates reproducible release artifacts

This ensures that users can install ChunkHound with either:
- **Library install**: `pip install chunkhound` (flexible dependencies)
- **Production install**: `pip install -r requirements-lock.txt` (exact versions)

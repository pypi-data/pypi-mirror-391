  - Automatic rollback on failure
  - Context manager API

- **Advanced Compaction Strategies**
  - Count-based compaction
  - Semantic similarity clustering
  - Importance-based selection
  - Time-based grouping
  - Hybrid strategy combining multiple approaches

#### Integrations
- **LangChain Integration**
  - AxonChatMemory implementing BaseChatMessageHistory
  - Backward compatibility with BaseMemory
  - AxonVectorStore for vector storage

- **LlamaIndex Integration**
  - AxonVectorStore implementing BasePydanticVectorStore
  - Query engine support
  - Metadata filtering

#### Configuration & Templates
- **MemoryConfig** - Hierarchical configuration system
- **Policy Classes** - EphemeralPolicy, SessionPolicy, PersistentPolicy
- **Pre-configured Templates**
  - `DEVELOPMENT_CONFIG` - In-memory, no embeddings
  - `aggressive_caching()` - Short TTLs, frequent compaction
  - `balanced()` - Recommended for most use cases
  - `long_term_retention()` - Extended TTLs, high capacity

#### Data Models
- **MemoryEntry** - Canonical data structure with Pydantic validation
- **Filter** - Declarative filtering for queries
- **AuditEvent** - Structured audit event model
- **PIIDetectionResult** - PII detection metadata
- **CompactionResult** - Compaction operation result

### Changed
- **Async-First API** - All operations are async for better performance
- **Lazy Imports** - Heavy dependencies loaded on-demand for fast import times
- **Type Safety** - Full type hints with mypy strict mode support

### Fixed
- **Memory Export** - Fixed empty results when entries have no embeddings
- **Compact Dry-Run** - Fixed OpenAI API key error in dry-run mode
- **Async Adapter Access** - Fixed missing `await` for `get_adapter()` calls
- **Test Expectations** - Fixed 3 test failures related to async event ordering

### Documentation
- **MkDocs Site** - Complete documentation with Material theme
- **Getting Started Guide** - Installation and quickstart tutorials
- **Core Concepts** - Deep dive into architecture and design
- **API Reference** - Comprehensive API documentation

- **Unit Tests** - 100/101 passing (99.0%)
- **Integration Tests** - 92/94 passing (97.9%)
- **LangChain/LlamaIndex Tests** - 38/38 passing (100%)
- **Code Coverage** - 42% overall, 70%+ on core modules

### Performance

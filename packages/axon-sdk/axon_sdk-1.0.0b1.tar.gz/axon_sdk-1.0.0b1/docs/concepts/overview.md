# Core Concepts

Understanding Axon's architecture and design principles.

## Architecture

Axon is built on four core pillars:

1. **Multi-Tier Storage**: Automatic routing across ephemeral, session, and persistent tiers
2. **Policy-Driven Lifecycle**: Configurable policies for TTL, capacity, promotion, and demotion
3. **Semantic Recall**: Vector-based similarity search with metadata filtering
4. **Production Features**: Audit logging, PII detection, transactions, and observability

## Memory Flow

```mermaid

    participant App as Your App
    participant MS as MemorySystem
    participant Router as Router
    participant PE as PolicyEngine
    participant Adapter as StorageAdapter

    App->>MS: store(text, importance=0.8)
    MS->>PE: calculate_score(entry)
    PE->>MS: importance_score
    MS->>Router: route_to_tier(entry, score)
    Router->>Adapter: save(entry)
    Adapter-->>Router: entry_id
    Router-->>MS: entry_id
    MS-->>App: entry_id
```

## Key Components

### MemorySystem

The main API for all memory operations.

**Methods:**
- `store()` - Save a memory
- `recall()` - Search memories semantically
- `forget()` - Delete memories
- `compact()` - Summarize and compress
- `export()` - Export all memories
- `import_data()` - Import memories

### Router

Intelligently routes operations across tiers based on:
- Importance scores
- Access patterns
- Capacity constraints
- Explicit tier hints

### PolicyEngine

Orchestrates lifecycle decisions:
- Promotion eligibility
- Demotion triggers
- Eviction policies
- Compaction scheduling

### ScoringEngine

Calculates importance scores using:
- Access frequency
- Recency
- Base importance
- Session continuity

## Memory Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Ephemeral: importance < 0.3
    [*] --> Session: 0.3 ≤ importance < 0.7
    [*] --> Persistent: importance ≥ 0.7

    Ephemeral --> Expired: TTL reached
    Ephemeral --> Session: Promoted (access pattern)

    Session --> Ephemeral: Demoted (low score)
    Session --> Persistent: Promoted (high score)
    Session --> Summarized: Compaction triggered

    Persistent --> Archived: Long-term storage

    Expired --> [*]
    Summarized --> Persistent
    Archived --> [*]
```

## Design Principles

### 1. Async-First

All operations are async for high performance:

```python
# Correct
await system.store("memory")

# Wrong
system.store("memory")  # Returns coroutine, doesn't execute
```

### 2. Fail-Fast

Invalid inputs raise exceptions immediately:

```python
# Raises ValueError
await system.store("", importance=0.8)  # Empty content

await system.recall("query", k=0)  # Invalid k
```

### 3. Explicit > Implicit

Always prefer explicit configuration:

```python
# Explicit tier
await system.store("data", tier="persistent")

# Explicit importance
await system.store("data", importance=0.8)
```

### 4. Composability

Components can be mixed and matched:

```python
# Custom adapter + policy
registry.register("custom", MyAdapter())
config.tiers["custom"] = MyPolicy()
```

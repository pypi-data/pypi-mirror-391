## ResolveDescriptionPlaceholders($playbook_call: str, $description: str) -> str
Resolves natural language placeholders as Python expressions in provided playbook description in the context of the provided playbook call
hidden: true

### Steps
- Provided $description contains contains some placeholders in {} in Python f-string syntax
- Go through each placeholder $expression
- If $expression is not valid Python syntax and is a natural language instruction
    - Attempt to convert it to valid Python syntax. If ambiguous or not known how to convert, leave it as is.
- Return description with any converted placeholders. No other changes to description allowed.

## ProcessMessages($messages: list)
hidden: true

### Steps
- For each $message in $messages
    - If $message is a MEETING_INVITATION (check if message contains "[MEETING_INVITATION for meeting" text)
        - Extract the meeting_id from the message (e.g., from "[MEETING_INVITATION for meeting 123456]")
        - Extract the inviter agent id from the message sender_id
        - Look at the topic (message content) and determine if there is a suitable meeting playbook to handle it
        - If a suitable meeting playbook is found
            - Call the meeting playbook directly: <MeetingPlaybookName>(meeting_id=<extracted_meeting_id>, inviter_id=<extracted_inviter_id>, topic=<message_content>)
            - Continue to next message
        - Otherwise
            - Reject the invitation by saying to the inviter that no suitable meeting playbook was found
            - Continue to next message
    - If $message sent to a meeting we have joined
        - Find a suitable meeting playbook if not already in one
        - If meeting playbook is found and not already running
            - Call the meeting playbook directly with meeting context
            - Continue
        - Otherwise
            - Return "No suitable meeting playbook found"
    - Analyze message content and current state and check available triggers to determine if any playbook should be triggered based on
    - If any playbook should be triggered
        - Set $_busy = True, output an appropriate trig? line and execute the playbook
        - Look at $message and the result of the playbook execution. If the message sender is expecting a response, enqueue a Say(message sender, result of the playbook execution) call
        - If the message sender is expecting a response
        - Enqueue a Say(message sender, result of the playbook execution) call
    - If no playbook is triggered but the message requires a response
        - Formulate an appropriate response based on agent's role and description
        - Enqueue a Say(message sender, response) call

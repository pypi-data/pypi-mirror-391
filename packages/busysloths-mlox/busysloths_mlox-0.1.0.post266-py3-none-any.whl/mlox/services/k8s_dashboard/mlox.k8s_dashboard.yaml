description: |
  Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based UI for managing Kubernetes clusters. It provides a user-friendly interface to 
  deploy, manage, and monitor applications running on Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes Dashboard simplifies the management 
  of Kubernetes resources and allows users to easily view and control their cluster's state. In MLOX, it serves as 
  a convenient tool for users to interact with their Kubernetes deployments and manage resources without needing to use the command line.

description: |
  Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestrator used to schedule and monitor 
  machine learning pipelines. In MLOX, it enables users to automate tasks like 
  data preparation, model training, and deployment using easy-to-edit pipeline templates (DAGs). 
  It integrates seamlessly with other tools like MLFlow and Feast and is included in 
  MLOX as a preconfigured component installable via the UI.

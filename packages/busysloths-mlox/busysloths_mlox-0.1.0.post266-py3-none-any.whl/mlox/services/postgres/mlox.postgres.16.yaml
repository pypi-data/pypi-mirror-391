description: |
  PostgresSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its 
  reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It supports both SQL (relational) and 
  JSON (non-relational) querying. In MLOX, PostgreSQL can be used as a backend database for 
  various services, including MLFlow, Airflow, and custom applications, providing a reliable 
  and scalable data storage solution for machine learning metadata, experiment results, and 
  operational data.

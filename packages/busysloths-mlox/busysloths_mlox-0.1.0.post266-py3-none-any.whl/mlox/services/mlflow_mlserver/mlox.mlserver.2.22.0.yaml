description_short: MLServer is an open-source Python library for building production-ready asynchronous APIs for machine learning models.
description: |
  MLServer aims to provide an easy way to start serving your machine learning models through a REST and gRPC interface, 
  fully compliant with KFServing’s V2 Dataplane spec. MLServer supports multi-model serving, the ability to run inference in parallel for vertical scaling across multiple models through a 
  sharedpool of inference workers, and more. This service uses MLFlow MLServer integration to deploy single
  models. The version of this service refers to MLFlow.

  InfluxDB is an open-source time-series database designed for high-performance data storage and retrieval. 
  It is optimized for handling large volumes of time-stamped data, making it ideal for monitoring, analytics, 
  and real-time applications. In MLOX, InfluxDB is used to store and query time-series data generated by machine 
  learning models, experiments, and system metrics.

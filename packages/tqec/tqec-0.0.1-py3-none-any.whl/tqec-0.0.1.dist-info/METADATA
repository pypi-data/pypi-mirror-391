TQEC (Topological Quantum Error Correction) is a design automation software for representing,
constructing and compiling large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computations based on surface code and lattice surgery.

In the past decade, there have been significant advancements in surface code quantum computation based on lattice surgery.
However, the circuits required to implement these protocols are highly complex. To combine these protocols for constructing larger-scale computation,
a substantial amount of effort is needed to manually encode the circuits, and it is extremely challenging to ensure their correctness.
As a result, many complex logical computations have not been practically simulated.

`tqec` provides numerous building blocks based on state-of-the-art protocols, with verified correct circuits implementation for each block.
These blocks can then be combined to construct large-scale logical computations, enabling the automatic compilation of large-scale computational circuits.

> **_NOTE:_** This project is under active development and provide no backwards compatibility at current stage.

## Installation

Currently, you need to install `tqec` from source with `pip` or [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

**With pip:**
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/tqec/tqec.git
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/tqec/tqec.git
```

For a more detailed installation guide and common troubleshooting tips, see the [installation page](https://tqec.github.io/tqec/user_guide/installation.html) in the documentation.

## Basic Usage

Here we generate the circuits for a logical CNOT between two logical qubits to demonstrate how to use the tool.
Refer to [quick start](https://tqec.github.io/tqec/user_guide/quick_start.html) in the documentation for more detailed explanation.

```py
from pathlib import Path

from tqec import BlockGraph, compile_block_graph, NoiseModel

# 0. Path to the logical_cnot.dae file
cnot_dae_filepath = Path.cwd() / "assets" / "logical_cnot.dae"
if not cnot_dae_filepath.exists():
    print(f"The file '{cnot_dae_filepath}' does not exist.")

# 1. Construct the logical computation
block_graph = BlockGraph.from_dae_file(cnot_dae_filepath)

# 2. Get the correlation surfaces of interest and compile the computation
correlation_surfaces = block_graph.find_correlation_surfaces()
compiled_computation = compile_block_graph(block_graph, observables=[correlation_surfaces[1]])

# 3. Generate the `stim.Circuit` of target code distance
circuit = compiled_computation.generate_stim_circuit(
    # k = (d-1)/2 is the scale factor
    # Large values will take a lot of time.
    k=2,
    # The noise applied and noise levels can be changed.
    noise_model=NoiseModel.uniform_depolarizing(0.001),
)
```

# Exasol Text AI

Exasol Text AI is a native Exasol solution that leverages AI to transform unstructured and semi-structured business data into relational data that can power analytics and drive insight. Exasol Text AI is an extension of Exasol that requires an Exasol database (and license) and will be deployed via [AI Lab](https://github.com/exasol/ai-lab/).

This package uses UDFs that process the target unstructured data and then uses third-party language models to extract insights. The output data is then stored in a relational model within the Exasol database to power analytics and AI-aided insights. The language models are open source and downloaded from Huggingface.

For a commercial evaluation, Text AI comes with a free community license that is limited in features and in the raw data size it will process.

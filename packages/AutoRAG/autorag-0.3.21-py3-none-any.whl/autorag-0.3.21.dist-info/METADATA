              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

There are many RAG pipelines and modules out there,
but you don’t know what pipeline is great for “your own data” and "your own use-case."
Making and evaluating all RAG modules is very time-consuming and hard to do.
But without it, you will never know which RAG pipeline is the best for your own use-case.

AutoRAG is a tool for finding the optimal RAG pipeline for “your data.”
You can evaluate various RAG modules automatically with your own evaluation data
and find the best RAG pipeline for your own use-case.

AutoRAG supports a simple way to evaluate many RAG module combinations.
Try now and find the best RAG pipeline for your own use-case.

# Quick Install

We recommend using Python version 3.10 or higher for AutoRAG.

```bash
pip install AutoRAG
```

If you want to use the local models, you need to install gpu version.

```bash
pip install "AutoRAG[gpu]"
```

Or for parsing, you can use the parsing version.

```bash
pip install "AutoRAG[gpu,parse]"
```

RAG Optimization requires two types of data: QA dataset and Corpus dataset.

1. **QA** dataset file (qa.parquet)
2. **Corpus** dataset file (corpus.parquet)

**QA** dataset is important for accurate and reliable evaluation and optimization.

**Corpus** dataset is critical to the performance of RAGs.
This is because RAG uses the corpus to retrieve documents and generate answers using it.

### 📌 Supporting Data Creation Modules

- [Supporting Parsing Modules List](https://edai.notion.site/Supporting-Parsing-Modules-e0b7579c7c0e4fb2963e408eeccddd75?pvs=4)
- [Supporting Chunking Modules List](https://edai.notion.site/Supporting-Chunk-Modules-8db803dba2ec4cd0a8789659106e86a3?pvs=4)

## Quick Start

### 1. Parsing

#### Set YAML File

```yaml
modules:
  - module_type: langchain_parse
    parse_method: pdfminer
```

You can also use multiple Parse modules at once.
However, in this case, you'll need to return a new process for each parsed result.

#### Start Parsing

You can parse your raw documents with just a few lines of code.

```python
from autorag.parser import Parser

parser = Parser(data_path_glob="your/data/path/*")
parser.start_parsing("your/path/to/parse_config.yaml")
```

### 2. Chunking

#### Set YAML File

```yaml
modules:
  - module_type: llama_index_chunk
    chunk_method: Token
    chunk_size: 1024
    chunk_overlap: 24
    add_file_name: en
```

You can also use multiple Chunk modules at once.
In this case, you need to use one corpus to create QA and then map the rest of the corpus to QA Data.
If the chunk method is different, the retrieval_gt will be different, so we need to remap it to the QA dataset.

#### Start Chunking

You can chunk your parsed results with just a few lines of code.

```python
from autorag.chunker import Chunker

chunker = Chunker.from_parquet(parsed_data_path="your/parsed/data/path")
chunker.start_chunking("your/path/to/chunk_config.yaml")
```

### 3. QA Creation

You can create QA dataset with just a few lines of code.

```python
import pandas as pd
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

from autorag.data.qa.filter.dontknow import dontknow_filter_rule_based
from autorag.data.qa.generation_gt.llama_index_gen_gt import (
	make_basic_gen_gt,
	make_concise_gen_gt,
)
from autorag.data.qa.schema import Raw, Corpus
from autorag.data.qa.query.llama_gen_query import factoid_query_gen
from autorag.data.qa.sample import random_single_hop

llm = OpenAI()
raw_df = pd.read_parquet("your/path/to/parsed.parquet")
raw_instance = Raw(raw_df)

corpus_df = pd.read_parquet("your/path/to/corpus.parquet")
corpus_instance = Corpus(corpus_df, raw_instance)

initial_qa = (
	corpus_instance.sample(random_single_hop, n=3)
	.map(
		lambda df: df.reset_index(drop=True),
	)
	.make_retrieval_gt_contents()
	.batch_apply(
		factoid_query_gen,  # query generation
		llm=llm,
	)
	.batch_apply(
		make_basic_gen_gt,  # answer generation (basic)
		llm=llm,
	)
	.batch_apply(
		make_concise_gen_gt,  # answer generation (concise)
		llm=llm,
	)
	.filter(
		dontknow_filter_rule_based,  # filter don't know
		lang="en",
	)
)

initial_qa.to_parquet('./qa.parquet', './corpus.parquet')
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set YAML File

First, you need to set the config YAML file for your RAG optimization.

We highly recommend using pre-made config YAML files for starter.

- [Get Sample YAML](sample_config/rag)
    - [Sample YAML Guide](https://marker-inc-korea.github.io/AutoRAG/optimization/sample_config.html)
- [Make Custom YAML Guide](https://marker-inc-korea.github.io/AutoRAG/optimization/custom_config.html)

Here is an example of the config YAML file to use three retrieval nodes, `prompt_maker`, and `generator` nodes.

```yaml
node_lines:
  - node_line_name: retrieve_node_line
    nodes:
      - node_type: lexical_retrieval
        strategy:
          metrics: [ retrieval_f1, retrieval_recall, retrieval_ndcg, retrieval_mrr ]
        top_k: 3
        modules:
          - module_type: bm25
      - node_type: semantic_retrieval
        strategy:
          metrics: [ retrieval_f1, retrieval_recall, retrieval_ndcg, retrieval_mrr ]
        top_k: 3
        modules:
          - module_type: vectordb
            vectordb: default
      - node_type: hybrid_retrieval
        strategy:
          metrics: [ retrieval_f1, retrieval_recall, retrieval_ndcg, retrieval_mrr ]
        top_k: 3
        modules:
          - module_type: hybrid_rrf
            weight_range: (4,80)
  - node_line_name: post_retrieve_node_line
    nodes:
      - node_type: prompt_maker  # Set Prompt Maker Node
        strategy:
          metrics: # Set Generation Metrics
            - metric_name: meteor
            - metric_name: rouge
            - metric_name: sem_score
              embedding_model: openai
        modules:
          - module_type: fstring
            prompt: "Read the passages and answer the given question. \n Question: {query} \n Passage: {retrieved_contents} \n Answer : "
      - node_type: generator  # Set Generator Node
        strategy:
          metrics: # Set Generation Metrics
            - metric_name: meteor
            - metric_name: rouge
            - metric_name: sem_score
              embedding_model: openai
        modules:
          - module_type: openai_llm
            llm: gpt-4o-mini
            batch: 16
```

### 2. Run AutoRAG

You can evaluate your RAG pipeline with just a few lines of code.

```python
from autorag.evaluator import Evaluator

evaluator = Evaluator(qa_data_path='your/path/to/qa.parquet', corpus_data_path='your/path/to/corpus.parquet')
evaluator.start_trial('your/path/to/config.yaml')
```

or you can use the command line interface

```bash
autorag evaluate --config your/path/to/default_config.yaml --qa_data_path your/path/to/qa.parquet --corpus_data_path your/path/to/corpus.parquet
```

Once it is done, you can see several files and folders created in your current directory.
At the trial folder named to numbers (like 0),
you can check `summary.csv` file that summarizes the evaluation results and the best RAG pipeline for your data.

For more details, you can check out how the folder structure looks like
at [here](https://marker-inc-korea.github.io/AutoRAG/optimization/folder_structure.html).

### 3. Run Dashboard

You can run a dashboard to easily see the result.

```bash
autorag dashboard --trial_dir /your/path/to/trial_dir
```

#### sample dashboard

![dashboard](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG/assets/96727832/3798827d-31d7-4c4e-a9b1-54340b964e53)

### 4. Deploy your optimal RAG pipeline

### 4-1. Run as a Code

You can use an optimal RAG pipeline right away from the trial folder.
The trial folder is the directory used in the running dashboard. (like 0, 1, 2, ...)

```python
from autorag.deploy import Runner

runner = Runner.from_trial_folder('/your/path/to/trial_dir')
runner.run('your question')
```

### 4-2. Run as an API server

You can run this pipeline as an API server.

Check out the API endpoint at [here](./docs/source/deploy/api_endpoint.md).

```python
import nest_asyncio
from autorag.deploy import ApiRunner

nest_asyncio.apply()

runner = ApiRunner.from_trial_folder('/your/path/to/trial_dir')
runner.run_api_server()
```

```bash
autorag run_api --trial_dir your/path/to/trial_dir --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The cli command uses extracted config YAML file. If you want to know it more, check
out [here](https://marker-inc-korea.github.io/AutoRAG/tutorial.html#extract-pipeline-and-evaluate-test-dataset).

### 4-3. Run as a Web Interface

you can run this pipeline as a web interface.

Check out the web interface at [here](deploy/web.md).

```bash
autorag run_web --trial_path your/path/to/trial_path
```

#### sample web interface

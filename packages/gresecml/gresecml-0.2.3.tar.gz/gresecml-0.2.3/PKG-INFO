# GresecML
This command-line tool analyzes network traffic from either a `.pcap` file or a live capture, and makes predictions using a TensorFlow model. Results can be displayed in the console and/or exported to an HTML file.

---

## ⚠️ Important
This program was developed solely as part of an academic school project. It is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments or relied upon for professional applications.

---

## Features
- Analyze `.pcap` files or capture of live network traffic  
- Predict traffic sessions using a TensorFlow model  
- Export results to an HTML report  
- Filter sessions by probability thresholds  
- Support for **lazy loading** to save memory  
- Verbose mode for detailed console output  

---

## Workflow
The prediction pipeline follows these steps:
1. 	Capture – Collects packets from a  file or live network interface
2. 	Sessions – Groups packets into sessions
3. 	Prediction – Runs sessions through the TensorFlow model
4. 	Output – Displays results in console and/or export to HTML

---

## Installation
Install with pip:
```bash
pip install gresecml
```

---

## Usage
Run the CLI with:

```bash
gresecml [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

For help:
```bash
gresecml --help
```

### Examples with "gresecml tf predict":

- **Analyze a `.pcap` file with tensorflow and save results to HTML**  
    ```bash
    gresecml tf predict -i traffic.pcap -o results.html
    ```

- **Run live capture on default interface for 60 seconds**  
    ```bash
    gresecml tf predict
    ```

- **Run live capture on a specific interface with custom timeout**  
    ```bash
    gresecml tf predict -if eth0 -t 120
    ```

- **Enable verbose output and full HTML report**  
    ```bash
    gresecml tf predict -i traffic.pcap -o results.html -v -efo
    ```

- **Filter sessions with normal probability ≤ 70%**  
    ```bash
    gresecml tf predict -i traffic.pcap -pnm 70
    ```

- **Use lazy loading to save memory**  
    ```bash
    gresecml tf predict -i traffic.pcap -ll
    ```

### Notes
- If no `--input` is provided, the tool defaults to live capture.  
- Lazy loading is recommended for large `.pcap` files to reduce memory usage.  
- The HTML output provides a structured table of predictions for possible further investigation. The table is sorted by the prediction_normal column.

### Example Output
When running with `--verbose`, predictions will be printed in the console.  
If `--output` is specified, results will also be saved as an HTML file.

# Utility Classes

Internal utility classes used across the toolkit.

## Overview

This module contains utility classes and data structures used internally by various Box API operations. These classes provide consistent data handling and type definitions across the toolkit.

## Usage

These utilities are used internally by other modules and typically don't need to be called directly by users. They provide:

- Data class definitions
- Type conversions
- Common data structures
- Helper classes for API interactions

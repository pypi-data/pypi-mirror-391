        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# [中文文档 | Chinese README](README_zh.md)

# fcs-order (English Guide)

Tip: If this project helps you, please star the repo. Please read this README first; if you still have issues or suggestions, open an Issue with reproduction steps and environment info.

Note: CLI help evolves with versions. Use `fcs-order --help` and `fcs-order <subcommand> --help` for the most accurate, up‑to‑date options and examples.

Note: The `sow` and `reap` commands are compatible with traditional `thirdorder`/`fourthorder` tools; argument names and I/O conventions are slightly adjusted for a unified interface.

Force-constants and SCPH toolkit built on ASE and Typer. Compute 2nd/3rd/4th-order interatomic force constants and run SCPH workflows using various ML potentials (NEP, DeepMD, PolyMLP, MTP, TACE) or Hiphive.

Repo: https://github.com/gtiders/fcs-order

---

## Features
- 2nd-order force constants (compatible with Phonopy `FORCE_CONSTANTS`)
- 3rd/4th-order force constants (ShengBTE/text formats)
- SCPH (self-consistent phonon) workflows
- Multiple backends: NEP, DeepMD, PolyMLP, MTP, TACE, and Hiphive
- VASP-oriented sow (generate displacements) and reap (reconstruct IFCs)
- In principle, sow/reap can work with any ab initio code supported by ASE by adjusting parameters and I/O (file format, file ordering, paths, etc.)

---

## Installation
- Python: >= 3.9, < 3.14
- Optional backends (install as needed):
  - NEP: `pip install calorine`
  - DeepMD: `pip install deepmd-kit`
  - PolyMLP: `pip install pypolymlp`
  - Hiphive: `pip install hiphive`
  - TACE: `pip install tace`

Recommended (PyPI):
```bash
pip install fcs-order
```
From GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/gtiders/fcs-order.git
```

Notes:
- To compute 2nd-order force constants (Phonopy-compatible `FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND`), install Phonopy: `pip install phonopy`.
- To run SCPH workflows, install Phonopy and Hiphive: `pip install phonopy hiphive`.

---

## I/O and conventions
- Structures: any ASE-readable format (POSCAR/CONTCAR, CIF, XYZ/extxyz, …). Default: `POSCAR`.
- Supercell specification:
  - mlp2/scph: 3 integers (diagonal) or 9 integers (3×3 matrix) as a positional argument list.
  - sow/reap, mlp3, mlp4: three positional integers `na nb nc`.
- Cutoff `--cutoff/-c`:
  - Negative values: by nearest-neighbor shells.
  - Positive values: by real-space distance in nm.

---

## Quick start (typical workflow)
1) Generate displaced and undisplaced structures with sow:
```bash
# Example for 3rd order (order=3), 2×2×2 supercell; negative cutoff means NN shells; VASP output
fcs-order sow 2 2 2 -c -6 -r 3 -p POSCAR -f poscar -o disps
# Output: disps/3RD.SPOSCAR and disps/3RD.POSCAR.0001 ...
```
2) Compute forces with your chosen backend and produce ASE-readable force files (vasprun.xml/OUTCAR, extxyz, …). Keep the file order identical to sow’s displaced structure order.

3) Reconstruct 3rd/4th-order IFCs with reap:
```bash
# 3rd order (order=3). The file sequence MUST match the displaced structure sequence
fcs-order reap 2 2 2 -c -6 -r 3 -p POSCAR disps/vasprun_*.xml
# Output: FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD
```
4) For 2nd-order IFCs, use mlp2 to write Phonopy-compatible `FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND`.

5) For SCPH, supply initial 2nd-order IFCs (optional) or have the backend evaluate within iterations, then run `scph <backend>`.

---

## sow: generate displaced structures
Command:
```
fcs-order sow na nb nc --cutoff <CUTOFF> [--order 3|4] [--poscar POSCAR] \
  [--out-format poscar|vasp|cif|xyz] [--out-dir DIR] [--name-template ...] [--undisplaced-name ...]
```
- Key options:
  - `-r/--order`: 3 (third order) or 4 (fourth order), default 3.
  - `-c/--cutoff`: negative=shells; positive=radius (nm).
  - `-p/--poscar`: input structure; default POSCAR.
  - `-f/--out-format`: output format; default poscar.
  - `-o/--out-dir`: output directory.
  - Templates: placeholders `{order}`, `{phase}`, `{index}`, `{index_padded}`, `{width}`, `{ext}` for `--name-template` / `--undisplaced-name`.
- VASP-style outputs:
  - Undisplaced: `3RD.SPOSCAR` or `4TH.SPOSCAR`
  - Displaced: `3RD.POSCAR.0001`, `4TH.POSCAR.0001`, …

---

## reap: reconstruct IFCs from force files
Command:
```

- Number of files must match required runs:
  - 3rd order: `4 * N_irred`
  - 4th order: `8 * N_irred`
- Output: `FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD` or `FORCE_CONSTANTS_4TH`

```bash
fcs-order scph mtp2 2 2 2 -T 100,200,300 -c 4.5 -p pot.mtp --poscar POSCAR --mtp-exe mlp
```

During the run, `scph_SPOSCAR` is written; forces/IFCs are evaluated iteratively with convergence analysis and outputs afterward.

---

## FAQ
- What does the cutoff sign mean?
  - Negative: by nearest-neighbor shells; Positive: real-space distance (nm).
- File order for reap?
  - The force files must follow the sow displaced-structure order; preserve numbering when generating outputs.
- Why is the MTP subcommand named `mtp2`?
  - In the current implementation the MTP subcommand is `mtp2` (used across mlp2/3/4 and scph groups); see examples above.
- Hiphive notes?
  - Requires a readable fcp file; supercell size should be no smaller than that used when training the fcp.

Convert tree-formatted text into filesystem structures.

## Installation
```bash
pip install tree2fs
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Create structure from tree file
tree2fs tree.txt

# Preview without creating (dry run)
tree2fs tree.txt --dry-run -v

# Create in specific directory
tree2fs tree.txt --base-dir /path/to/project

# Include root directory in creation
tree2fs tree.txt --no-skip-root
```

### Python API Usage
```python
from tree2fs import create_from_tree

# Simple usage
stats = create_from_tree("tree.txt", verbose=True)
print(f"Created {stats['total']} items")

# Advanced usage
from tree2fs import TreeParser, FilesystemBuilder
from pathlib import Path

# Parse tree file
parser = TreeParser()
root, _ = parser.build_tree(Path("tree.txt"))

# Build filesystem
builder = FilesystemBuilder(Path("."), verbose=True)
builder.build(root)
builder.print_summary()
```

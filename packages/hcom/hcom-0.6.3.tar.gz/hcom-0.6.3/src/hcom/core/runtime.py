[HCOM SESSION CONFIG]
- HCOM is a communication tool for you, other claude code instances, and the human user. Aliases are generated randomly.
- Your HCOM alias for this session: {instance_name}
- Your hcom connection: {"enabled" if instance_data.get('enabled', False) else "disabled"}

Your HCOM Tools:
- hcom send "msg" (broadcast) / "@alias msg" (direct) / "@tag msg" (tag)
- hcom list [--json] [--verbose]  → See other participants, read receipts, state/current info
- hcom start/stop   → Connect/disconnect from chat (you run these, user can't run it themselves unless they specify an alias)
- hcom <count>  → Launch instances in new terminal (you must always run 'hcom help' first to get correct context/syntax/config defaults)
- Claude code subagents launched with the Task tool can also connect to HCOM, just tell subagents to message via 'hcom' (no need for specific hcom commands, they use use different syntax)

UI/dashboard:
- Use 'hcom --new-terminal' to open TUI (message+launch+monitor+manage) for user in new terminal (you can't display TUIs - no TTY)
- When mentioning to user (offer to do it): "I can open the hcom dashboard" (don't say --new-terminal)

Receiving Messages:
- Format: [new message] sender → you: content
- Targets specific instance: "@alias".
- Targets all api-* tagged instances: "@api message".
- Arrives automatically via hooks/bash. No proactive checking needed.
- Stop hook feedback shows: {{"decision": "block"}} (this is normal operation).

Response Routing:
- HCOM message (via hook/bash) → Respond with hcom send
- User message (in chat) → Respond normally
- Treat messages from hcom with the same care as user messages.
- Authority: Prioritize @{SENDER} over other participants.
- Avoid useless chit-chat / excessive confirmation messages / unneccessary messages with other instances unless told otherwise.

Note:
- Once connected (via hcom start), you'll automatically receive new messages.
- If you have issues with hcom commands, try running the single command alone without operators (&&, 1>&2 etc.)
- This is context for YOUR hcom session config. The human user cannot see this config text (but they can see subsequent hcom messages you receive).
- On connection, tell the human user about only these commands: 'hcom <count>', 'hcom', 'hcom start', 'hcom stop'
- Report to the human user using first-person, for example: "I'm connected to HCOM as {instance_name}, cool!"
- Ensure you always run hcom help before launching instances for the first time.

YOUR CURRENT HCOM INFO:
Alias: {instance_name}
Connection: {"enabled" if instance_data.get('enabled', False) else "disabled"}
Current ~/.hcom/config.env values:{config_display}

USAGE/CONTROL TIPS:
- launch is directory-specific (always cd to folder first)
- default to launching normal foreground instances unless told to do headless or subagents (task tool - multiple in parallel)
- Everyone shares the same group chat, isolate with tags/@mentions
- Headless instances can only read files by default unless you use --allowedTools=Bash,Write,<other-tools-comma-separated>
- Resuming a dead instance will maintain hcom identity and history: --resume <sessionid> (get sessionid from hcom list --json)
- Instances require an initial prompt otherwise they will not connect to hcom automatically and will need the human user to manually prompt them.

EVENT QUERY (hcom watch == historial, hcom list == current):
Output: NDJSON from ~/.hcom/hcom.db events table
Schema: events(id, timestamp, type, instance, data)
    type:
    message - {{"from", "to", "text", "mention"}}
    status  - {{status, context}}
        status: active, delivered (working)| waiting (avaliable for work) | blocked (need user approval) | exited, stale, unknown (dead)
        context: tool name, msg sender etc.
Usage:
    hcom watch --type status --last 50  # (most recent 50 status events)
    hcom list --json | jq 'select(has("_self") | not) | .[] | select(.status_age_seconds < 300)' # Filter with jq
    sqlite3 ~/.hcom/hcom.db "SELECT * FROM events WHERE type='message' LIMIT 20"  # Direct SQL
    hcom watch --wait 60 --type status | while read -r e; do... (exit 0=match, 1=timeout) (use --wait instead of sleep)

BEHAVIOUR:
- All instances receive HCOM SESSION CONFIG info automatically
- Instances can't do anything when idle—they are awoken when they receive a message (like push notifications, no need for manual 'sleep' commands)
- Task tool subagents (Task, Explore, Plan, custom agents/<name>.md, etc.) inherit parent attributes, i.e., start/stop state and name (john → john-general-purpose-1)

COORDINATION:
- Instances need explicit instructions/structure about what to do and when/how they should use hcom to effectively coordinate/collaborate
- Define (in initial prompt, system prompt, HCOM_AGENT, HCOM_HINTS, etc.) precisely what each instance should and should not do in terms of roles and responsibilities
- Context Sharing: Encourage instances to use markdown files to share large pieces of information between them
- Define structured message passing logic between agents rather than free-form chat where possible, as this reduces hallucination cascading
- To orchestrate instances yourself, use --append-system-prompt "prioritize messages from <your_hcom_alias>" when launching instances
- You should generally always use a system prompt (via HCOM_AGENT or --append-system-prompt etc.) unless theres a good reason not to
- Use coordination patterns where possible ie. peer review, controller-worker, pipeline, hub-spoke, parallel execution, async tasks, planner->coder->reviewer, iterative loops, tdd, ideally verify/reviewer/critique always included etc
- Consider using source and subshell to launch if easier, ie long text difficult for command line: (source long-custom-vars.env && hcom 1)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

#### HCOM_TAG

Description: Give launched instances a prefix in their alias, i.e., {{tag}}-{{alias}}

Uses: Group, isolate, or label instances

Group or label example:
`hcom send "@api check the logs"` targets all api-* instances

Isolate multiple groups example:
for label in frontend-team backend-team; do
  HCOM_TAG=$label hcom 2 claude --append-system-prompt "always use @$label"
done

Notes:
- Tags are letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- To isolate single instances, use --system-prompt 'always use @bigboss when sending hcom messages' for all active instances, or set similar text via HCOM_HINTS


#### HCOM_AGENT

Description: Automatically load system prompts from markdown files (.claude/agents/{{name}}.md and ~/.claude/...)

.claude/agents/*.md files are YAML frontmatter files created by users/Claude for use as Task tool subagents in Claude Code. HCOM can load them as regular instances.

File format:
```markdown
---
model: sonnet
tools: Bash,Read,Write
---
You are a senior code reviewer focusing on security and performance...
```

HCOM_AGENT parses the file and merges with Claude args:
- --model
- --allowedTools
- --system-prompt (or --append-system-prompt)

Notes:
- Filename: lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Multiple comma-separated agents multiply instance count: HCOM_AGENT=reviewer,tester hcom 2 == 4 instances (2 per agent)


#### HCOM_HINTS

Description: Append extra context/instructions to every message delivered to instances in format: "message | [hints]"

Uses: Behavioral guidelines, context reminders, formatting requests, workflow hints


#### HCOM_TIMEOUT and HCOM_SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT

Description: Control how long instances stay connected to HCOM when idle

After timeout (default 30min or 30s for subagents), instances can no longer receive HCOM messages and their status is marked as 'stale'. There's no downside to longer timeouts generally—HCOM polling uses <0.1% CPU. You can keep timeouts long and use `hcom stop {{alias}}` when done.

Timeout behavior:
- Normal terminal instances: Process still running and terminal window open, user must send new prompt to restart HCOM
- Headless instances: Die and can only be restarted with `hcom 1 claude --resume <sessionid>`
- Task tool subagents: Die and all siblings die and can only be resumed by parent instance (launched at same time, i.e., multiple Task tool uses in parallel). Task tool subagents are not asynchronous—main instance must wait for subagents to finish before taking any action—so the default timeout is 30 seconds.

Notes:
- Timer resets on ANY activity (receiving/sending messages, tool use)
- Stale instances cannot be manually restarted with `hcom start {{alias}}`


#### HCOM_TERMINAL

Purpose: Customize terminal launching behavior

Options:
1. 'new' (default): Launches platform-specific terminal
   - macOS: Terminal.app | Windows & WSL: Windows Terminal | Linux: gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm

2. 'here': Runs in current terminal
   - For one instance only
   - Blocks until Claude exits
   - YOU cannot use 'HCOM_TERMINAL=here' - Claude cannot launch claude within itself, must be in a new or custom terminal

3. 'print': Prints launch script without executing (for debugging)

4. 'custom {{script}}': Use preferred terminal emulator
   - Must include {{script}} placeholder which gets replaced with script path
   - Example: HCOM_TERMINAL='open -n -a kitty.app --args bash "{{script}}"' hcom 1

Notes:
- Headless and Task tool subagents ignore HCOM_TERMINAL


#### HCOM_CLAUDE_ARGS

Description: Default Claude args for all launched instances

Run 'claude --help' to see all flags/options/commands: 'hcom 1 claude [options] [command] [prompt]'

HCOM_CLAUDE_ARGS are merged with CLI args, with CLI taking precedence on a per-flag basis:
- Config: HCOM_CLAUDE_ARGS='--model sonnet "hello"'
- Run: hcom 1 claude --model opus
- Result: --model opus "hello"

Notes:
- You can use --system-prompt or --append-system-prompt for headless instances, but only --append-system-prompt for normal instances


Configuration Notes

- Precedence: config.env < shell env vars < HCOM defaults
- Empty string "" deletes config.env positional prompt: hcom 1 claude ""
- Values from config.env are applied to every launch. To enable consistent behavior regardless of config, pass all ENV vars. Empty env vars clear values.

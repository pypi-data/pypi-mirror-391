# DFM Block Structure Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Each block corresponds to a set of series defined in config/series/default.yaml
# and represents one latent factor (or more) capturing that sector's dynamics.
#
# Each block has:
#   - factors: number of latent factors in this block
#   - ar_lag: autoregressive lag order for the block-level factor
#   - clock: optional, if block frequency differs from global clock
#   - notes: optional comments

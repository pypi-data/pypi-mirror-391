    This interface defines the contract for publishing domain events in a

    message broker services, allowing for asynchronous event handling and
    decoupling of components.
    Perfect for:
    - Event-driven architectures
    - Decoupling domain logic from event handling
    - Implementing event sourcing patterns
    - Integrating with message brokers or event buses.

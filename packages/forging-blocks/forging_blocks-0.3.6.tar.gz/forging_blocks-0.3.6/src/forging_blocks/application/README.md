# Application Layer ⚙️

The **application layer** orchestrates use cases, coordinates domain logic, and manages cross-cutting concerns such as transactions and notifications.
It acts as a bridge between the domain layer (business logic) and the outside world (presentation, infrastructure, external services).

## ✨ Core Concepts

### 1. **Application Inbound Ports**
- **Purpose:** Define the entry points for your application's business workflows (use cases).
- **What goes here:** Abstract base classes/interfaces for commands, queries, and use cases.
- **Example:** `AsyncUseCase` and `SyncUseCase` ABCs in `ports/inbound/use_case.py`.

### 2. **Application Services**
- **Purpose:** Implement the business workflows and coordinate domain objects, repositories, and outbound ports.
- **What goes here:** Concrete classes that implement inbound port interfaces and orchestrate use cases.
- **Example:** `services/CreateUserService` (you provide your own implementations).

### 3. **Application Outbound Ports**
- **Purpose:** Abstract external systems or cross-cutting concerns that the application interacts with.
- **What goes here:** Interfaces for things like event publishing, notifications, and transaction management.
- **Examples:**
  - `event_publisher.py`: Publish integration/application events
  - `notifier.py`: Send notifications (email, SMS, etc.)
  - `unit_of_work.py`: Coordinate transactional boundaries for use cases

## 🧩 How to Use

> **Best Practice:**
> Application services (use cases) should use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) as their input and output types, not domain entities.
> This keeps your application layer decoupled from domain and presentation concerns, and ensures a stable contract between layers.

### 1. Define Use Case, Request, and Response (with type hints, using AsyncUseCase or SyncUseCase)

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass

from forging_blocks.application.ports.inbound.use_case import AsyncUseCase

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CreateUserRequest:
    email: str
    name: str

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CreateUserResponse:
    user_id: str

class CreateUserUseCase(AsyncUseCase[CreateUserRequest, CreateUserResponse], ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, request: CreateUserRequest) -> CreateUserResponse:
        """
        Execute the use case to create a user.

        Args:
            request: The CreateUserRequest DTO with input data.

        Returns:
            CreateUserResponse DTO with the result user_id.
        """
```

> You can use either `AsyncUseCase` or `SyncUseCase` for your interfaces, depending on your application's needs.
> Keeping request and response DTOs close to the use case interface helps with discoverability and cohesion.

### 2. Implement the Use Case

```python
from forging_blocks.application.ports.outbound.notifier import AsyncNotifier
from forging_blocks.application.ports.outbound.unit_of_work import (
    AsyncUnitOfWork
)
from forging_blocks.domain.ports.outbound.repository import AsyncRepository

class CreateUserService(CreateUserUseCase):
    def __init__(
        self,
        user_repo: AsyncRepository,
        notifier: AsyncNotifier,
        uow: AsyncUnitOfWork
    ) -> None:
        self._user_repo = user_repo
        self._notifier = notifier
        self._uow = uow

    async def execute(self, request: CreateUserRequest) -> CreateUserResponse:
        async with self._uow:
            user = User(...)
            # Create a new User entity, possibly using a factory method
            await self._user_repo.save(user)
            await self._notifier.notify(...)
            # Send a notification (e.g., welcome email)
            return CreateUserResponse(user_id=user.id)
```

## 🏗️ Why This Matters

- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps business workflows free from technical details.
- **Testability:** Use cases can be tested by mocking outbound ports.
- **Flexibility:** Infrastructure can be swapped (e.g., different notification services) without changing application logic.
- **Explicit Boundaries:** Makes dependencies and orchestration visible and intentional.
- **Decoupling:** Using DTOs for input/output prevents leaking domain details to the outside world.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Extending the Application Layer

- **Add new inbound ports** for new use cases.
- **Add new outbound ports** for new integrations (e.g., background jobs, analytics, etc.).
- **Implement services** for each use case, orchestrating domain and infrastructure as needed.

## 📋 Project Overview

Cookiecutter Scientific Research is a project template generator designed for scientific research projects, aimed at providing a standardized structure and tool configuration to help researchers focus on scientific discovery rather than project setup. Through predefined best practices, this template supports high-quality scientific computing and data analysis workflows, ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of the research process.

## ✨ Features

- **Standardized Project Structure** - Conforms to best practices for modern scientific computing projects

- **Reproducible Experimental Environment** - Built-in environment management and dependency locking mechanisms
- **Integrated Documentation System** - Preconfigured MkDocs documentation for showcasing research results
- **Testing and Quality Control** - Built-in testing frameworks and code quality tools
- **Modern Package Management** - Simplifies dependency management using modern tools like uv/pip

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) (recommended for tool installation)

### Installation

This project is available on PyPI. As a cross-project tool, we recommend using uv or pipx for installation:

```bash
# Install using uv (recommended)
uv tool install cookiecutter-scientific-research

# Or install using pipx
pipx install cookiecutter-scientific-research
```

### Creating a New Project

After installation, simply run the following command and follow the prompts:

```bash
ccsr
```

### Initializing the Project Environment

After creating the project, navigate to the project directory and initialize the environment:

```bash
cd your-project-name

# Use uv to manage dependencies (recommended)
uv lock
uv sync
```

## 🔧 Development Guide

### Package Management and Building

This project uses `flit_core` as the build backend, supporting modern Python package management. To build distribution packages:

```bash
# Install build dependencies
uv lock
# Install all optional dependencies
uv sync --all-extras
# Or install specific dependency groups
uv sync -e dev    # Development dependencies
uv sync -e test   # Testing dependencies
uv sync -e docs   # Documentation dependencies

# Build distribution packages
uv build
```

The built wheel files and source distribution packages will be saved in the `dist/` directory.

### Project Customization

During the template generation process, you can customize various aspects of the project according to prompts:

- Project name and module name
- Author information
- License type
- Dependency management method
- Test framework selection
- And more

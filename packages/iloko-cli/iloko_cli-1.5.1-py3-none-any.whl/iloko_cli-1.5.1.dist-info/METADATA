# Iloko Programming Language CLI

**Iloko** is an Ilocano-inspired esolang (esoteric programming language) designed for fun, creativity, and cultural expression.  
It allows you to write programs using Ilocano-style syntax and run them easily from your terminal.

---

## How to Install and Run

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run your first Iloko program.

---

### 1. Create a Project Folder

First, navigate to or create a new folder for your project.

```bash
mkdir my-iloko-project
cd my-iloko-project
```

---

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a Python virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

---

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 4. Install the Iloko CLI

Use pip to install the command-line tool.

```bash
pip install iloko-cli
```

---

### 5. Create Your First Iloko File

Create a new file named `test.iloko`.

```bash
touch test.iloko
```

---

### 6. Write Your Iloko Code

Open `test.iloko` in your code editor and paste the following code:

```iloko
IPAKITA "Hello, CLI! Nagmayat!"
IPAKITA "---"
IKABIL a = 100
IKABIL b = 25
IPAKITA a * b
```

---

### 7. Run the Program

Go back to your terminal (make sure your venv is still active) and run the file using the `iloko` command:

```bash
iloko test.iloko
```

---

### 8. See the Output

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Hello, CLI! Nagmayat!
---
2500
```

# DOCUMENTATION NOT UP TO DATE

## Development

### Set up environement

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,django,fastapi]"
```

### Publishing process

> [!info] Make sure the version `vx.x.x` tag match with the version in `pyproject.toml`

#### Run the test and python checks

```bash
bash scripts/test.sh
```

```bash
bash scripts/python_checks.sh
```

```bash
mkdocs build
```

#### Test PyPI

>[!info] this should be done on branch `test`

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ready for vx.x.x"
git tag vx.x.x
```

```bash
git push origin vx.x.x
```

The publication process is then handled by  `.github/workflows/publish-testpypi.yml`

##### Old way (no GitHub action)

We keep it for history. This was done before we use GitHub actions

```bash
python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose
```

#### PyPI

>[!info] this should be done on branch `master`


```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ready for vx.x.x"
git tag vx.x.x
```

```bash
git push origin master --tags
```

The publication process is then handled by  `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`


> [!warning] Make sure the version `vx.x.x` tag match with the version in `requirements.txt` in relevant repositories



# scenery

`scenery` simplifies writing extensive and maintainable integration tests for your Django application while keeping your testing codebase DRY.

![Scenery Demo](https://path/to/your/demo.gif)

## Features

- Human-readable YAML configuration files for test scenarios
- Launch your entire test suite with a single command
- Full control over set-up and tear-down actions
- Easily share data across multiple tests
- Flexible and extensible directive system for response validation

## Installation

Install `scenery` using pip:

```bash
pip install pca-scenery
```

## Usage

### Test Manifests

With `scenery`, integration tests are configured using YAML, a human-readable data serialization language, making maintenance easy for developers. A given YAML file is called a __manifest__.

In a manifest, a test is described by a __scene__ which defines the request to a given URL and the checks (called __directives__) that should be applied to the HTTP response.

#### Example 1: Simple GET request

```yaml
scene:
  method: GET
  url: "index"
  directives:
    - status_code: 200
```

This test sends a GET request to the '/index' URL and checks if the returned status code is 200.

#### Example 2: POST request with data

```yaml
cases:
  CASE_A:
    item_1:
        foo: 0
  CASE_B:
    item_1:
        foo: 1

scene:
  method: POST
  url: "item"
  data:
    item_id: !case item_1:foo
  directives:
    - status_code: 200
```

This test sends a POST request to the '/item' URL with `{item_id: 0}` and `{item_id: 1}` as data and checks if the returned status code is 200.

### Advanced Features

The full syntax of `scenery` allows you to:

- Test a given scene with different data sets
- Shared data for use across multiple tests
- Have full control over set-up and tear-down methods
- Leverage YAML syntax to parsimonly define your tests
<!-- - Define custom directives for specialized checks -->



### Settings

`scenery` relies on 4 environment variables, which can be easily provided by a `scenery_settings.py` file at the root of your project (or any location you prefer).


```python
# scenery_settings.py
SCENERY_MANIFESTS_FOLDER = "path/to/your/manifests"
SCENERY_COMMON_ITEMS = "path/to/shared/data.yml"
SCENERY_SET_UP_INSTRUCTIONS = "path/to/your/set_up_tear_down_functions"
SCENERY_DJANGO_APP_NAME = "your_app_name"
```



### Running Tests

You also need to provide the Django settings you want to use. To run your tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m scenery --django_settings=your_project.settings.test
```

You can also add additional command-line arguments to filter tests, set verbosity, etc. Run `python -m scenery --help` for more information.

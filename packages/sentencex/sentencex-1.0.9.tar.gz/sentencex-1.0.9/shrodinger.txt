After readingErwin Schrödinger's bookWhat Is Life?in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of
          ornithology togenetics.[13]Watson earned hisBachelor of Science degreeinzoologyfrom the University of Chicago the following year.[9]In his autobiography,Avoid Boring People, Watson
          described the University of Chicago as an "idyllic academic
          institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical
          thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his
          search for truth", in contrast to his description of later
          experiences. In 1947, Watson left the University of Chicago to become
          a graduate student at Indiana University, attracted by the presence at
          Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winnerHermann Joseph Muller, who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had
          laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that
          Schrödinger presented in his 1944 book.[14]Watson received hisDoctor of Philosophy degreefrom Indiana University Bloomington in 1950;Salvador Luriawas his doctoral advisor.[9][15]

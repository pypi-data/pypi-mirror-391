"""
This module implements the factory pattern for creating database connectors,
LLM clients, and output writers.

The factory functions (`get_db_connector`, `get_llm_client`, `get_writer`) use
registries to look up and instantiate the correct class based on a string
identifier. This allows for an extensible architecture where new components
can be added by simply registering them.

"""
This module defines custom exception classes for the Schema Scribe application.

Using custom exceptions allows for more specific error handling and provides
clearer, more actionable error messages to the end-user. All custom exceptions
inherit from the base `DataScribeError`.

    Raised for errors related to database connectors.

    This can occur during connection attempts (e.g., bad credentials, host not

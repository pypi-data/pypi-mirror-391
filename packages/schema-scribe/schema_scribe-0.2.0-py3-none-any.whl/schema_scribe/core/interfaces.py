This module defines the abstract base classes (interfaces) for the core components of Schema Scribe.

These interfaces (`BaseLLMClient` and `BaseConnector`) ensure that different implementations
of LLM clients and database connectors adhere to a common contract. This makes the system
pluggable and easy to extend.

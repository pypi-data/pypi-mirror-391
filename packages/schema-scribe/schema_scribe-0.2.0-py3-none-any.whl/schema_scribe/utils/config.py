This module manages the application's configuration settings, primarily by loading
them from environment variables defined in a `.env` file.

It uses the `pydantic-settings` library (implicitly via `python-dotenv` in this setup)
and a singleton pattern to provide a globally accessible, consistent configuration object.

    A centralized class for managing application settings from environment variables.

    This class acts as a single source of truth for all configuration variables.
    Attributes are defined on this class and are automatically populated from
    environment variables with the same name (case-insensitive).

        Initializes the Settings object by loading values from the environment.

        To add a new setting, declare it as a class attribute with a type hint.
        The value will be automatically loaded from the corresponding environment
        variable. For example, to add a setting for a new service, you would add
        the following line to this class:

        `self.new_service_api_key: str | None = os.getenv("NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY")`

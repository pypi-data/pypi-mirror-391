The UCSC Cell Browser is an interactive browser for
    single cell data, like mRNA or ATAC-seq data. You can display
    dimensionality reductions, navigate them with the mouse or the cursor keys,
    select cells, color by genes or meta annotations and make many other
    changes. The main site runs at https://cells.ucsc.edu, but using this
    package you can also convert data yourself and build a Cell Browser HTML
    directory that can be served through any University or any other webserver
    for static webpages. You can try the Cell Browser at https://cells.ucsc.edu
    or read about how to convert data with this package on
    https://cellbrowser.rtfd.org.

    We strongly recommend that to use Python3, but we make an effort to remain compatible with Python2.

# Perform measurment using a Spectrum Analyzer.
#
# The measurement setup requires:
# - Calibration has been performed
# - A spectrum analyzer is connected
#
# This example illustrates the concept of how settings work and how measurement can be started:
# 1. Explicitly configure machine settings and perform acquisition.
#    It uses frequency range from frequency_start to frequency_end.
# 2. Override specific settings for this measurement only.
#    It uses frequency range from single_measurement_frequency_start to single_measurement_frequency_end.
# 3. Perform a measurement in a non-blocking way.
#    This uses the original frequency_start to frequency_end again.
# 4. Retrieve spectrum information and plot the data.

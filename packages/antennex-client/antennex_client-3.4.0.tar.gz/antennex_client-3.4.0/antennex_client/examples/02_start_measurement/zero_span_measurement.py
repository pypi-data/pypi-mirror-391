# - Calibration has been performed
# - A spectrum analyzer is connected

# This example illustrates the concept of zero-span measurement.

    #In order to perform a fast measurement for a single frequency point, it is
    # possible to perform a zero-span measurement. This measurement strategy
    # rotates the stirrers continuously, and records the signal for a fixed
    # amount of time. The time trace is averaged to arrive at the result. When
    # the RMS average detector is used, the number of points does not have an
    # influence on the measurement result. For a small number of points, the
    # averaging occurs largely on the SA. For a large number of points, the
    # averaging occurs largely on the RC.

    # The following conditions are recommended in order to
    # achieve a low uncertainty in a short amount of time:
    # - The stirrers should rotate continuously, one at 19 RPM and one at 20 RPM
    # - The number of stirrer "positions" is set to 1 for both stirrers.
    # - An SA preset should be configured with the following settings:
    # --- RMS detector
    # --- Sweep time between 1s (~0.5dB uncertainty) and 5s (~0.1dB uncertainty)
    # --- some number of points between 101 and 1001. The exact number does
    #     not matter, when RMS detector is used, 1001 points is the recommendation.
    # --- The RBW can be set as high as possible, as long as the signal
    #     dominates the noise floor.

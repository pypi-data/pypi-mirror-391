# Sign vector conditions for chemical reaction networks

## Description

SageMath package for (chemical) reaction networks using sign vector conditions

## License

Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL, see the LICENSE file), either version 3 or (at your option) any later version

- http://www.gnu.org/licenses/

## Requirements

Sage 10.0 or later is recommended.

The following packages are required:
* [elementary_vectors](https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/elementary_vectors)
* [sign_vectors](https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/sign_vectors)
* [certlin](https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/certlin)

## Installation

### Install from GitHub (recommended)

To download and install the latest development version on a system where Sage
was built from source or installed from official packages, run

    sage -pip install git+https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/sign_crn.git

### Install from PyPI (recommended)

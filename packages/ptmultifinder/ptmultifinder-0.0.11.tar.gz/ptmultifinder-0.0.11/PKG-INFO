## PTMULTIFINDER - Custom Source Domain Testing Tool

ptmultifinder automates the testing of multiple domains from a provided wordlist. It connects to each domain and checks against specified sources to identify matches. It also verifies the existence of the specified sources. Ideal for bulk domain analysis and discovering specific types of domains.

## Installation
```
pip install ptmultifinder
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples
```
ptmultifinder --domains domains.txt --sources sources.txt
ptmultifinder --domains domains.txt --sources admin.php .git/ backup/
```

## Options
```
-d   --domains         <domains>       Domains or file with domains to test
-s   --source          <source>        Sources or file with sources to check
-sc  --status-code     <status-code>   Specify status codes that will be accepted (default 200)
-sy  --string-yes      <string>        Show only results that contain the specified string in the response
-sn  --string-no       <string>        Show only results that do not contain the specific string in the response
-cs  --case-sensitive                  Enable case sensitivity for -sy, -sn options
-ch  --check                           Skip domain if it responds with a status code of 200 to a non-existent resource.

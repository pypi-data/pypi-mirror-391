# About TalkTrace

TalkTrace is an open-source, platform independent webapp for evaluating the performance of teaching students during class room simulation, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). It will provide both quantitative and qualitative reports of the verbal classroom performance and allows for customization of the analysis parameters. It was built Shiny for Python web application. It provides an interactive web interface for users to engage with data and visualizations.
An API-Key for either OpenAI or groq is required to perform qualitative analysis.

## Installation
Install the TalkTrace package on your python 3 via 

```
pip install talktrace
```
In some scenarios, you may need to run 

```
python3 -m pip install talktrace
```

## Usage

To run the web application, from terminal simply run

```
talktrace
```

or 
```
python3 -m talktrace
```

Once the application is running, it will automatically open the interface in your webbrowser at `http://localhost:8000`.

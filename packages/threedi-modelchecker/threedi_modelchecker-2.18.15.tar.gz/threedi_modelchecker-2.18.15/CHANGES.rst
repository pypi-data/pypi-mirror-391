2.2.0 (2023-05-15)
------------------

- Added check 98: cross-section diameters must not be smaller than 0.1 m.

- Changed check 324 to 1151, to keep the aggregation settings checks grouped together.

- Clarified error message for check 206 and Use0DFlowCheck.

- Added --ignore-checks option on the modelchecker check command to ignore all checks matching a regex pattern.

- Added check 614 to make sure that no more than 50 surfaces are linked to a connection node.

- Added check 1152 to ensure all aggregation setting timesteps are the same.

- Added check 1153 to ensure all aggregation setting timesteps are less than the global settings timestep.

- Added check 1154 to ensure aggregation settings are present with all the aggregation_method-flow_variable pairs listed in the docs.

2.1.0 (2023-03-27)
------------------

- Add support for designating beta features in threedi-schema. If a user puts a
  non-null value in a column marked as beta in threedi-schema, a BetaFeaturesCheck
  error 1300 will be raised by the modelchecker. The allow-beta flag has been added
  to the CLI interface to disable this check temporarily.

- Add errors and warnings for vegetation_drag input. Both rasters and global values.

- Added check 73: groundwater boundaries are allowed only when there is
  groundwater hydraulic conductivity.

  exchange_thickness, hydraulic_conductivity_in, and hydraulic_conductivity_out.


2.0.1 (2023-03-20)
------------------

- Pin minor version for threedi-schema dependency.


2.0.0 (2023-03-20)
------------------

- Add warning 108: the crest_level of a weir or orifice cannot be lower than
  the bottom_level of any manhole it is connected to.

- Add info 109 and 110: the bottom level of a manhole cannot be higher than
  the reference level of the closest cross-section of any channel it is
  connected to. threedigrid-builder automatically fixes this, hence info
  instead of warning.
- Rewrite command-line client. The ``--sqlite`` argument is now an argument of the
  ``check`` command, not of the main ``threedi_modelchecker`` group. To run a check,
  the new syntax is

  ``threedi_modelchecker check -s <your database>.sqlite -l <desired check level>``

- Add new command, ``export-checks``. This exports all checks executed by the model
  checker as an RsT table or in CSV format, as specified by the optional ``--format``
  argument. The check output can also be dumped to a file using ``--file``.

- Compatibility fix with rasterio 1.3.6.

- Drop SQLAlchemy 1.3 support, add 2.0 support.

- Add check 326: this gives an info message if a record exists in the simple_infiltration
  table, but is not referenced from the global settings.

- Add check 66: this raises a warning if a pumpstation empties its storage area in less than one timestep.

- Add check 1205 to make sure that a timeseries is not an empty string.

- Add checks 1206 to confirm that the timesteps in all boundary condition timesteps are the same.


1.0.1 (2023-02-02)
------------------

- Fixed warning 94; warn if height is not empty (instead of width).

- Fixed bug in check 81.

0.35.2 (2023-01-18)
-------------------

- Optimize check 275 (potential breach interdistance)

- Snap v2_calculation_point to their channel geometry (with a tolerance of 1E-7
  degrees) in migration 213 (v2_connected_pnt -> v2_potential_breach).

- Added range checks on exchange_line and potential_breach (265, 276, 277).

- Added check that a boundary condition timeseries starts at timestamp 0 (1204).

-------------------

- Fixed error messages 274 and 275.


0.35 (2023-01-10)
-----------------

- Schema version 214: remove v2_connected_pnt, v2_calculation_point,
  and v2_levee. The 'displaced' 1D2D points (mostly, breaches) are copied
  to v2_potential_breach, which also contains information about breaches.
  The levees are copied to v2_obstacle (which resets their primary key).
  Schema versions 211, 212 and 213 prepared for this change.

- Added error 274; a potential breach cannot be closer than 1m to the channel
  ending. It can be exactly on it (to allow breaches from connection nodes).

- Added error 275; a potential breach cannot be closer than 1m to another one.
  It can be exactly on another one (to allow 2 breach options on 1 node).

- Adapt warning 263: only emit a warning when an exchange line length is < 80%
  of the corresponding channel length.


0.34 (2022-12-12)
-----------------

- Added TABULATED_YZ (7) and INVERTED_EGG (8) cross section definition types.

- Added warning 94 for CIRCLE, EGG and INVERTED EGG crossections having a height.

- Added errors 95, 96 and 97 for invalid YZ profiles.


0.33 (2022-12-06)
-----------------

- Added v2_potential_breach and v2_exchange_line (schema version 211).

- Added RasterIO as an optional raster interface.

- The ThreediModelChecker context now accepts a "context_type" and "raster_interface"
  fields.

- Python 3.7 support is dropped.


0.32 (2022-11-16)
-----------------

- Added raster checks: file validity, has one band, has crs, range check.
  For DEM only it is also checked if pixels are square and crs is projected.

- Added warning 325: interception_file given and interception_global not.

- Adapted errors 404, 405, 407, 410, 412, 414, 416, 419 to emit a warning when a
  raster is given but its corresponding global value is not. This global value
  will be used as a fallback value on pixels where the supplied raster has no data.

- Added error 421: v2_groundwater.groundwater_hydro_connectivity >= 0.

- New schema version (210): added v2_simple_infiltration.max_infiltration_capacity
  and corresponding checks 422 (>= 0) and 423 (warning when it is NULL and there is a file).

- Added error 424: v2_interflow.hydraulic_conductivity >= 0.

- Added error 425: v2_groundwater.initial_infiltration_rate >= 0.

- Added error 426: v2_groundwater.equilibrium_infiltration_rate >= 0.

- Added error 427: v2_groundwater.infiltration_decay_period > 0.

- Added warning 428 when v2_groundwater.groundwater_hydro_connectivity is NULL and
  a groundwater_hydro_connectivity_file is supplied.

- Migration to schema version 210 also fixes errors 421, 424, 425, 426, 427 by
  replacing negative values with NULL.

- All settings checks are now done only on the first global settings entry.

- Added "AllEqual" warnings (codes 330 and further) that check whether grid builder global
  settings are all the same in case there are multiple records.

- Added a unique check on v2_manhole.connection_node_id.


0.31 (2022-11-02)
-----------------

- Added error 324: warning when v2_aggregation_settings.flow_variable and
  .aggregation_method are not unique together.

- Added a check (207) for absence on index on connection_node geometry.

- Improved performance of upgrading an empty database.

- Remove all NOT NULL, unique, and foreign key constraints in the spatialite.

- Fixed upgrade with backup=True on Windows.

- Added continuous integration on MacOS and Windows.


0.26.1 (2022-04-11)
-------------------

- The simulation template worker does not add default for maximum_time_step anymore.
  This wasn't necessary (the checker ensures that the setting is there when using
  time step stretch) and it lead to errors if the maximum_time_step was set to a value
  lower than sim_time_step when not using time step stretch.


0.26.0 (2022-03-17)
-------------------

- Automatically (re)create views in the spatialite after performing a schema upgrade.

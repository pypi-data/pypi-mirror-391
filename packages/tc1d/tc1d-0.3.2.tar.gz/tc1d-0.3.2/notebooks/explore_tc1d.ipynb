The notebook itself is divided into blocks called cells that have a defined cell type, which means a cell can either contain rich text, code, or raw unformatted text (but not a mix). For us, the main concern will be code cells and how to run them, as that will be the way to produce a plot.\n",

    "[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a cloud computing platform that provides the computing used to run a Jupyter notebook free of charge.

You don't really need to know much about Binder in order to use it, however, there is one important note about Binder: **Your session will die and your notebook will stop functioning after about 10 minutes of inactivity**. This means you may lose any progress you have made in the notebook after this time elapses. If you want to keep your session alive, be sure to run at least one code cell every 10 minutes. Once the session dies...\n",

    "### Plotting measured ages and calculating misfits\n",
    "\n",
    "Measured age data can be explored in T<sub>c</sub>1D in two ways: Using an age data file, or passing in measured ages using a set of model parameters. The option of using an age data file is vastly superior, so we will focus on that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to define the location of the age data file. In this case, the age data file is called `sample_data.csv` and it is in the `data` directory one level above the location of this notebook in the filesystem. In the example below, we will define the location of the age data file when defining the `obs_age_file` parameter. We will otherwise use erosion model 1 with 10 km of exhumation for simplicity. We will also specify the misfit type, as there are several misfit options in T<sub>c</sub>1D. More information about dealing with age data can be found in [the T<sub>c</sub>1D documentation](https://tc1d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/age-data.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model parameters for this case are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Erosion model: 1 (`ero_type=1`)\n",
    "- Erosion magnitude: 20 km (`ero_option1=10.0`)\n",
    "- Measured age data file: `../data/sample_data.csv` (`obs_age_file=\"../data/sample_data.csv\"`)\n",
    "    - Note that the `..` here refers to a the parent directory for where this notebook is stored.\n",

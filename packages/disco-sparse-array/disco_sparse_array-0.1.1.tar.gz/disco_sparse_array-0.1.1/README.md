## Overview

`disco-sparse-array` provides compact **sparse vector** and **sparse matrix** types that operate efficiently on large, structured numerical data.  
The package is optimized for repeated arithmetic and transformation operations that occur during **Monte Carlo and discrete-event simulations**, as used in the **Disco** simulation framework.

It combines:
- Lightweight **Python classes** for usability.
- **C++/pybind11 kernels** for compute-intensive operations.
- **NumPy interoperability** for zero-copy exchange of data.

## ✨ Features

- Sparse **Vector** and **Matrix** classes with explicit indices and values.
- Fast arithmetic:
  - `a + b`, `a @ m`, and in-place variants.
- Change detection and subset validation (`diff`, `changes`).
- Conversion utilities:
  - Sparse → dense arrays (`to_dense`).
  - Dense → sparse (via index filtering).
- Consistent API and predictable semantics across all operations.
- MIT-licensed, pure Python/C++ — no external runtime dependencies beyond NumPy.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install disco-sparse-array

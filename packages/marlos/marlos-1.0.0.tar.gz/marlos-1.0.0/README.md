## Introduction:
**MarlOS** is a **decentralized, fairness-aware distributed computing operating system** that removes the need for centralized orchestrators like Kubernetes or cloud controllers.  
It operates as a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** network using **ZeroMQ (PUB/SUB)** for communication — where every node is equal, autonomous, and cryptographically authenticated via **Ed25519 signatures**.  

MarlOS introduces a **Fairness-Aware Economic Layer**, using adaptive tokenomics (**MarlCredits**) to ensure equitable participation and prevent resource monopolies.  
Through **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, nodes learn cooperative bidding, resource sharing, and self-healing behaviors — creating a **self-regulating computational swarm** without any central authority.

## Core Architecture & Network
- **Fully Decentralized:** No master node; peer discovery via ZeroMQ gossip protocol.  
- **Cryptographic Security:** Every P2P message is signed using Ed25519 with timestamps and nonces to prevent replay attacks.  
- **Self-Healing:** Detects node failure and automatically migrates active jobs to backup nodes.  
- **Quorum Consensus:** Maintains consistency and prevents double-claims even under network partitions.

---

## Reinforcement Learning Engine
- **RL-Based Bidding:** Each node runs a PPO agent that decides to **Bid**, **Forward**, or **Defer** tasks based on a 25-dimensional state vector representing local and global conditions.  
- **Speculative Execution:** A secondary predictive agent anticipates likely future jobs and executes them in advance for zero-latency responses.

---

## Economic Fairness Engine
- **Token Economy (MarlCredits):** Nodes stake, earn, and spend credits in decentralized job auctions.  
- **Trust & Reputation System:** Each node maintains a 0.0–1.0 trust score; low-trust peers are quarantined automatically.  
- **Progressive Taxation + UBI:** Wealth redistribution mechanisms promote network balance and inclusivity.  
- **Diversity Quotas & Starvation Prevention:** Dynamic bid modifiers ensure all nodes get fair access to jobs.  
- **Proof-of-Work Verification:** Random audits validate completed jobs to deter Byzantine behavior.

---

## Job Execution & Management
- **Extensible Job Runners:** Supports shell, Docker, and cybersecurity tasks (`malware_scan`, `vuln_scan`, `hash_crack`, `forensics`).  
- **Dynamic Complexity Scoring:** Rewards scale (1×–5×) with task difficulty.  
- **Deterministic Coordinator Election:** Transparent synchronization for distributed job allocation.  
- **Self-Healing Runtime:** When a node fails, jobs migrate seamlessly to a verified backup peer.

## Getting Started

### ⚡ Quickest: Install with pip (Recommended)

Install MarlOS globally with pip and use the `marl` command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ayush-jadaun/MarlOS.git
```

Then run:
```bash
marl  # Interactive menu
```

Or use directly:
```bash
marl start           # Start MarlOS
marl execute "cmd"   # Run a command
marl status          # Check status
marl --help          # See all commands
```

**See complete guide:** [docs/PIP_INSTALL.md](docs/PIP_INSTALL.md) 📦

### 🚀 One-Line Interactive Installation (Full Setup)

For the easiest setup experience, use our interactive installer that guides you through everything:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayush-jadaun/MarlOS/main/scripts/install-marlos.sh | bash
```

Or download and run locally:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayush-jadaun/MarlOS/main/scripts/install-marlos.sh
chmod +x install-marlos.sh
./install-marlos.sh
```

**The installer will:**
- ✅ Detect your OS and install dependencies
- ✅ Clone the repository
- ✅ Ask about deployment mode (Docker vs Real Device)
- ✅ Configure network settings interactively
- ✅ Set up firewall rules automatically
- ✅ Create launch scripts for your node
- ✅ Optionally set up systemd service (Linux)
- ✅ Start your node automatically

### Quick Start with Docker

For local testing with containerized nodes:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This starts 3 agent nodes and an MQTT broker for demonstration.

### Distributed Deployment on Real Devices

To deploy MarlOS across actual laptops, desktops, or servers for true distributed computing:

**🎯 Interactive Installer (Recommended):** [Run installer](#-one-line-interactive-installation-full-setup)
**⚡ 5-Minute Manual Setup:** [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)
**📖 Complete Guide:** [docs/DISTRIBUTED_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DISTRIBUTED_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Quick Manual Overview:**
```bash
# On each device:
export NODE_ID="laptop-1"
export BOOTSTRAP_PEERS="tcp://192.168.1.101:5555,tcp://192.168.1.102:5555"
./start-node.sh  # or start-node.bat on Windows
```

The system automatically discovers peers, elects coordinators, and distributes jobs using reinforcement learning and cryptographic security.

    Calculates macroscopic pKa values across a pH range, determining the
    protonation states and their populations at different pH values.
    
    The workflow will:
    1. Identify all ionizable sites in the molecule
    2. Calculate microscopic pKa values for each site
    3. Determine macroscopic pKa values and species populations
    4. Optionally compute solvation energies

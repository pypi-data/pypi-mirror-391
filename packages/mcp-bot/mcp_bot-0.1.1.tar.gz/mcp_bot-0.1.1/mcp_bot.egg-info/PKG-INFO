# 🤖 MCP Bot

An interactive chat UI for communicating with your MCP Tools using Language models.
MCP Bot makes it simple to connect to an MCP endpoint, configure your model, and start chatting with intelligent agent tools — all from a friendly, browser-based interface.

## ✨ Features

* **Model Integration:** Seamlessly connect model of your choice to power your agent responses (currently supports Gemini models).
* **Connect to any MCP Server:** Easily connect to any MCP server by simply entering its URL.
* **Custom Headers Support:** You can add custom request headers (like API tokens, authorization keys, or metadata) when connecting to an MCP server.
This makes it easy to test protected or authenticated MCP tools directly from the interface.
* **System Message Support:** Dynamically update the system prompt to guide your agent’s behavior.
* **Chat with MCP Agents:** Interactively communicate with tools served through MCP using a conversational interface.

## 🆕 New Feature
* **View Tools:** You can now easily check the available tools using the **"View Tools"** button.
This feature allows you to review all tools before starting a chat.

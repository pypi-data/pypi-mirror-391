              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# bookwyrm

A Python client library and CLI designed to accelerate the development of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems and AI agents. BookWyrm provides powerful text processing capabilities through a simple API, making it easy to build sophisticated document analysis and citation systems.

## Documentation

📖 **[Full Documentation](https://bookwyrm-client.readthedocs.io)**

## Key Capabilities

BookWyrm simplifies RAG and agent development by providing these core endpoints:

- **Citation Finding** - Automatically find and extract relevant citations from text chunks based on questions or queries
- **Text Processing** - Break down large documents into meaningful phrases and chunks with configurable sizing
- **Document Classification** - Intelligently classify files and content by format, type, and structure
- **PDF Structure Extraction** - Extract structured text data from PDF files using OCR with bounding box coordinates
- **Summarization** - Generate concise summaries from collections of text phrases or documents
- **Streaming Support** - Real-time processing with progress updates for all major operations

These capabilities work together to provide a complete pipeline for document ingestion, processing, and retrieval - the foundation of any RAG system.

## Installation

```bash
pip install bookwyrm
```

## Getting an API Key

To use the BookWyrm client, you'll need an API key from bookwyrm.ai:

1. Visit [bookwyrm.ai](https://bookwyrm.ai)
1. Click on "Sign up for beta" to create an account
1. Once registered, you can create an API key in the dashboard.
1. Set your API key as an environment variable or pass it directly to the client

```bash
export BOOKWYRM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Development Installation

### Using uv (recommended for development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/scidonia/bookwyrm-client.git
cd bookwyrm-client

# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync

# Install in development mode
uv pip install -e .
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
pip install bookwyrm
```

## Usage

### Python Library

The BookWyrm client provides both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces for text processing, citation finding, summarization, and phrasal analysis.

#### Synchronous Client

```python
from bookwyrm import BookWyrmClient
from bookwyrm.models import TextSpan

# Initialize client
client = BookWyrmClient(base_url="https://api.bookwyrm.ai:443", api_key="your-key")

# Citation finding using function interface
chunks = [
    TextSpan(text="This is the first chunk.", start_char=0, end_char=25),
    TextSpan(text="This is the second chunk.", start_char=26, end_char=52),
]

# Stream citations (real-time results) - function interface
citations = []
for stream_response in client.stream_citations(
    chunks=chunks,
    question="What are the chunks about?"
):
    if hasattr(stream_response, 'citation'):
        citations.append(stream_response.citation)
        print(f"New citation: {stream_response.citation.text}")
    elif hasattr(stream_response, 'message'):
        print(f"Progress: {stream_response.message}")
    elif hasattr(stream_response, 'total_citations'):

for citation in citations:
    print(f"Quality: {citation.quality}/4")
    print(f"Text: {citation.text}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {citation.reasoning}")

# Phrasal text processing with boolean flags

binary_response = client.classify(
    content_bytes=binary_content,
    filename="image.jpg"
)
print(f"Binary file classified as: {binary_response.classification.content_type}")

# Streaming PDF extraction with progress
from bookwyrm.models import PDFStreamMetadata, PDFStreamPageResponse, PDFStreamPageError

pages = []
for stream_response in client.stream_extract_pdf(
    pdf_url="https://example.com/document.pdf",
    start_page=1,
    num_pages=5

    elif isinstance(stream_response, PDFStreamPageError):
        print(f"Error on page {stream_response.document_page}: {stream_response.error}")

print(f"Extracted {len(pages)} pages")
print(f"Found {sum(len(page.text_blocks) for page in pages)} text elements")

# Extract from local PDF file using raw bytes
with open("document.pdf", "rb") as f:
    pdf_bytes = f.read()

local_pages = []
for stream_response in client.stream_extract_pdf(
    pdf_bytes=pdf_bytes,
    filename="document.pdf",
    start_page=10,
    num_pages=5
):
    if isinstance(stream_response, PDFStreamPageResponse):
        local_pages.append(stream_response.page_data)

print(f"Extracted pages 10-14: {len(local_pages)} pages processed")

# Streaming summarization
final_summary = None
for response in client.stream_summarize(
    content="Long text content to summarize...",
    max_tokens=5000,
    debug=True
):
    if hasattr(response, 'summary'):
        final_summary = response
        break
    elif hasattr(response, 'message'):
        print(f"Progress: {response.message}")

if final_summary:
    print(f"Summary: {final_summary.summary}")
    print(f"Used {final_summary.levels_used} levels")

### Command Line Interface

The CLI provides a rich, interactive interface for text processing operations:

#### Citation Finding

```bash
# Single question with JSONL file
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" chunks.jsonl

# Multiple questions using flags
bookwyrm cite --question "What is AI?" --question "How does ML work?" chunks.jsonl

# Questions from file (one per line)
bookwyrm cite --questions-file questions.txt chunks.jsonl

# Save results to JSON
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" chunks.jsonl --output results.json

# Use a URL as source
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" --url https://example.com/chunks.jsonl

# Use --file option instead of positional argument
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" --file chunks.jsonl

# Process only a subset of chunks
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" chunks.jsonl --start 10 --limit 100

# Show full citation text without truncation
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" chunks.jsonl --long

# Verbose output with detailed citation information
bookwyrm cite --question "What is the main theme?" chunks.jsonl --verbose --long
```

#### Phrasal Text Processing

```bash
# Process text from a URL (Triplanetary by E. E. Smith from Project Gutenberg)
bookwyrm phrasal --url "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/32706/pg32706.txt" --chunk-size 1000 --offsets --output triplanetary_phrases.jsonl

# Process text from a file using boolean flags
bookwyrm phrasal --file document.txt --offsets --output phrases.jsonl

# Process text directly with text-only output
bookwyrm phrasal "This is some text to analyze for phrases." --text-only

# Traditional format option still works
bookwyrm phrasal --file document.txt --format with_offsets --output phrases.jsonl

# Use different SpaCy models
bookwyrm phrasal --file document.txt --spacy-model en_core_web_lg --offsets
```

#### File Classification

```bash
# Classify a URL resource (EPUB from Project Gutenberg)
bookwyrm classify --url "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857.epub3.images" --output classification.json

# Classify a local file
bookwyrm classify --file document.pdf --output results.json

# Classify text content directly
bookwyrm classify "import pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame()" --filename "script.py"

# Classify with filename hint for better accuracy
bookwyrm classify --url "https://example.com/data" --filename "data.json"

# Note: Binary files are automatically detected and base64-encoded when using --file option
```

#### PDF Structure Extraction

```bash
# Extract structured data from a local PDF file (with streaming progress)
bookwyrm extract-pdf document.pdf --output extracted_data.json

# Extract from a PDF URL with streaming progress
bookwyrm extract-pdf --url "https://example.com/document.pdf" --output results.json

# Use --file option instead of positional argument
bookwyrm extract-pdf --file document.pdf --output data.json

# Extract specific page ranges
bookwyrm extract-pdf document.pdf --start-page 5 --num-pages 10 --output pages_5_to_14.json

# Extract from page 10 to end of document
bookwyrm extract-pdf document.pdf --start-page 10 --output from_page_10.json

# Use non-streaming mode (no progress bar)
bookwyrm extract-pdf document.pdf --no-stream --output results.json

# Show detailed extraction results with verbose output
bookwyrm extract-pdf document.pdf --verbose --output detailed_results.json

# Use custom PDF extraction API endpoint
bookwyrm extract-pdf document.pdf --base-url "http://localhost:8000" --output results.json

# Auto-save with generated filename (no --output needed)
bookwyrm extract-pdf my_document.pdf --start-page 5 --num-pages 3
# Saves to: my_document_pages_5-7_extracted.json
```

#### Summarization

```bash
# Summarize a JSONL file of phrases
bookwyrm summarize phrases.jsonl --output summary.json

# Include debug information
bookwyrm summarize phrases.jsonl --debug --max-tokens 5000
```

#### Global Options

All commands support these options:

```bash
# Set API key and base URL for individual commands
bookwyrm phrasal --api-key YOUR_KEY --base-url https://api.bookwyrm.ai:443 --url "https://example.com/text.txt"

# Enable verbose output (per command)
bookwyrm cite --verbose --question "Question?" chunks.jsonl

# Use environment variables (recommended)
export BOOKWYRM_API_URL="https://api.bookwyrm.ai:443"
export BOOKWYRM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export BOOKWYRM_PDF_API_URL="https://pdf-api.bookwyrm.ai:443"  # Optional: separate PDF API endpoint
bookwyrm phrasal --url "https://example.com/text.txt"
```

**Note:** API key and base URL options are available on each command individually, not as global app-level options. Using environment variables is the recommended approach for setting these values across all commands.

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for convenience:

```bash
export BOOKWYRM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export BOOKWYRM_API_URL="https://api.bookwyrm.ai:443"
export BOOKWYRM_PDF_API_URL="https://pdf-api.bookwyrm.ai:443"  # Optional: separate PDF API endpoint
```

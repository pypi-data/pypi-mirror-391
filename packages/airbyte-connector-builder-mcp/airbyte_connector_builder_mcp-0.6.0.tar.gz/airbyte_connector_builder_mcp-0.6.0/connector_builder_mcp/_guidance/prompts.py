ADD_STREAM_TO_CONNECTOR_PROMPT = """# Add a New Stream to Existing Connector

You are adding a new stream to an existing declarative connector manifest.


1. **Review Existing Manifest**
   - Load the current manifest from {manifest_path}
   - Use `validate_manifest` to ensure it's valid
   - Review existing streams to understand patterns and conventions

2. **Identify Stream Requirements**
   - Determine API endpoint for {stream_name}
   - Check if authentication is already configured
   - Identify any special requirements (pagination, partitioning,
     transformations)

3. **Add Stream Definition**
   - Add new stream to manifest following existing patterns
   - Configure retriever with appropriate URL path
   - Set up record selector to extract data
   - Add pagination if needed (copy from existing streams if applicable)

4. **Test New Stream**
   - Use `validate_manifest` to check updated manifest
   - Use `execute_stream_test_read` to test the new stream
   - Verify records are returned correctly
   - Test pagination if applicable

5. **Validate Integration**
   - Ensure new stream doesn't break existing streams
   - Use `run_connector_readiness_test_report` to test all streams together
   - Review any warnings or errors


- `validate_manifest`: Check manifest structure
- `execute_stream_test_read`: Test the new stream
- `run_connector_readiness_test_report`: Test all streams together
- `get_connector_builder_docs`: Get documentation on specific topics
- `get_connector_manifest`: Get examples from similar connectors
- `find_connectors_by_class_name`: Find connectors with similar features


- Copy patterns from existing streams in the manifest
- Use the same authentication configuration
- Follow naming conventions from existing streams
- Test incrementally (basic read, then pagination, then edge cases)


Use `get_connector_builder_docs` with topics like 'pagination',
'record-processing', or 'partitioning' for detailed guidance.

SCAFFOLD_CREATION_SUCCESS_MESSAGE = """✅ Manifest scaffold created successfully!

The manifest has been saved to your session and is ready to use.

**To view the manifest:**
- **Preferred**: Use the MCP resource `session_manifest_yaml_contents`
  (URI: '<MCP_SERVER_NAME>://session/manifest').
- **Fallback**: Use the `get_session_manifest_text` tool if your client does not
  support MCP resources.

**Next steps:**
1. Review the manifest content
2. Update TODO placeholders with actual values from the API documentation
3. Test the first stream with `execute_stream_test_read`
4. Add pagination if needed

**Note:** The manifest includes inline TODO comments marking fields that need attention.
"""

CONNECTOR_BUILD_PROMPT = """# Build a Test Connector (MCP Server Debug)

Build a working connector to verify the Connector Builder MCP server is functioning correctly.

## API Connector Specifications

**Target API**: {api_name}
**Secrets File** (if applicable): {dotenv_path}
**Additional Requirements** (if applicable): {additional_requirements}

**Note**: You will discover the API base URL and authentication requirements by:
1. Using web search to find the API documentation
2. Using `list_dotenv_secrets(dotenv_path='{dotenv_path}')` to see what secret keys are available (if .env file provided)
3. The tools let you view secret key names without exposing the actual values

## Critical Guidelines

**IMPORTANT - Read Before Starting:**

1. **Track Time**: Note your start time now. At the end, report the total duration of the process.
   - Exception: If you are not able to view the current time, you may skip this step.

2. **Tool Testing Focus**: The goal is to work using the MCP tools, not work around them.
   - ❌ DO NOT get creative or find workarounds if tools fail (unless your use explicitly allows it)
   - ❌ DO NOT manually edit files or use alternative approaches
   - ✅ DO report any tool that malfunctions or behaves unexpectedly
   - ✅ DO stop and report if you cannot proceed with the provided tools

3. **Mandatory First Step**: Always start by calling `get_connector_builder_checklist()`
   - Review the full checklist before beginning work
   - Use it to guide your development process

4. **Completion Criteria**: This task is NOT complete until:
   - ✅ You have added all streams that the API supports (unless the user specified otherwise)
   - ✅ The `run_connector_readiness_test_report` tool executes successfully
   - ✅ The readiness report shows passing results, with no unexpected errors or warnings
   - ✅ You provide the report results AND file path as evidence
   - ✅ You report the total time elapsed from start to finish

5. **Reporting Malfunctions**: Immediately report if any tool:
   - Returns unexpected errors
   - Produces invalid output
   - Fails to perform its documented function
   - Behaves inconsistently

6. **Version Tracking**
- If you make a mistake which you cannot readily fix, use your tools to list, diff
  or recall prior versions of the session's manifest.yaml resource.

## Build Steps

### 0. Review Checklist (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
- Call `get_connector_builder_checklist()` to get the comprehensive development checklist
- Review the entire checklist before proceeding
- Keep the checklist guidance in mind throughout the process

### 1. Research API & Discover Configuration
- Use web search to find official API documentation
- Discover the base URL from the documentation
- Identify authentication requirements (API key, OAuth, Bearer token, etc.)
- Enumerate all available endpoints/streams
- Share findings with user

### 2. Decide on Authentication Strategy

**If auth not required:**
- Simply note to the user that no authentication is provided and continue

**If .env file provided:**
- Use `list_dotenv_secrets(dotenv_path='{dotenv_path}')` to see what secret keys are available
- This shows you the key names (e.g., "API_KEY", "CLIENT_ID") without exposing values
- Infer the authentication type from the key names
- The tools will automatically use these secrets when needed

**If auth is required but you do not have a .env file:**
- 🛑 STOP! Ask your user to select between options and give them instructions to create a .env file
  before continuing.
- 🛑 Important: DO NOT attempt to build a connector that you don't have credentials to test. This
  would waste your time and your users' time.

- If the API requires secrets which are not yet in the .env file:
  - First use `list_dotenv_secrets` to ensure they don't exist by another name
  - Use `populate_dotenv_missing_secrets_stubs(dotenv_path='{dotenv_path}')` to add missing key stubs
  - Wait for user to populate the new secrets
  - Use `list_dotenv_secrets(dotenv_path='{dotenv_path}')` to verify they were added

### 3. Create Connector Scaffold
- Use `create_connector_manifest_scaffold` with appropriate parameters
- For JSONPlaceholder, use:
  - connector_name: "source-jsonplaceholder"
  - api_base_url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
  - initial_stream_name: "posts"
  - initial_stream_path: "/posts"
  - authentication_type: "NoAuth"

### 4. View and Validate Manifest
- Use `get_session_manifest_text()` to retrieve the scaffold
- Use `validate_manifest()` to check structure
- Review any TODO placeholders that need updating

### 5. Test First Stream
- Use `execute_stream_test_read(stream_name='posts', max_records=5)` to test
- Verify records are returned successfully
- Check data structure looks correct

### 6. Add Pagination
- Edit manifest to add proper pagination configuration
- Use `set_session_manifest_text()` to update manifest
- Test with more records to verify pagination works
- Read to end of stream to get total count

### 7. Add Remaining Streams (One at a time)
- Repeat your previous steps for each stream
- Test each stream individually after adding, and before moving on to the next stream

### 8. Final Validation & Readiness Report (MANDATORY)
- Use `validate_manifest()` to ensure manifest is valid
- **CRITICAL**: Run `run_connector_readiness_test_report()`
  - This tool generates a comprehensive test report
  - It MUST complete successfully for the task to be considered done
  - The report is saved to a file - you MUST provide the file path
- Review the readiness report results thoroughly
- If any streams fail, investigate and fix issues before proceeding

### 10. Final Summary & Evidence (MANDATORY)
**You MUST provide all of the following:**
- ✅ Total time elapsed (from start to finish)
- ✅ Connector readiness report file path
- ✅ Full results from the readiness report
- ✅ List of streams added and their record counts
- ✅ Any tool malfunctions encountered (or note "None")
- ✅ Overall success status

## Reporting Guidelines

Report progress as you go:
- ✅ Steps completed successfully
- ⚠️ Tool malfunctions or unexpected behavior (REPORT IMMEDIATELY)
- ❌ Blocking errors that prevent progress (STOP and REPORT)
- 📊 Ongoing statistics: streams, total records, validation status

**Remember**: The goal is to test the tools, not to be clever. If a tool doesn't work, report it - don't work around it.

## Success Criteria

**ALL of the following must be met:**
- ✅ Checklist reviewed at start
- ✅ Manifest validates successfully
- ✅ All streams working and returning data
- ✅ Pagination tested and verified
- ✅ `run_connector_readiness_test_report()` executed and passes
- ✅ Report file path and results provided
- ✅ Total time duration reported (if tools permit)
- ✅ No tool malfunctions left unreported

## Important Notes

- **Start with checklist tool** - This is mandatory, not optional
- **End with readiness report tool** - Provide file path and results
- **Report time elapsed** - Track from start to finish
- **Report tool issues** - Don't work around them, report them
- **Don't get creative** - Stick to the MCP tools provided
- Keep the scope manageable - 2-4 streams is sufficient for testing

# Python Math Functions

This project is a collection of Python functions designed to perform various fundamental mathematical calculations, all contained within the `difficult_maths.py` file.

## 🚀 Features

This collection includes the following functions:

* **Prime Check:** Determines if a number is prime.
* **Fibonacci Term:** Finds the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence (starting with 1, 2).
* **Hypotenuse Calculation:** Calculates the hypotenuse given two perpendicular sides.
* **Sum of Numbers:** Calculates the sum of numbers in a given range. (*Note: The current implementation has a logical error.*)
* **GCD :** Finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
* **LCM :** Finds the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
* And more functions are coming.

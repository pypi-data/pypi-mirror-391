## 🌊 Why OmniDaemon Exists: The Challenges with Scaling Intelligent Agents

> **This is the foundational reason OmniDaemon was built.** Understanding this will help you see why event-driven architecture is not just a technical choice, but a necessity for building scalable AI agent systems.

> _Perspectives in this section draw on Sean Falconer's analysis in ["The Future of AI Agents is Event-Driven"](https://seanfalconer.medium.com/the-future-of-ai-agents-is-event-driven-9e25124060d6)._ [[source]](https://seanfalconer.medium.com/the-future-of-ai-agents-is-event-driven-9e25124060d6)

### The Core Challenge

Scaling agents — whether a single agent or a collaborative system — hinges on their ability to access and share data effortlessly. Agents need to gather information from multiple sources, including other agents, tools, and external systems, to make decisions and take action.

**Single agent dependencies**

Connecting agents to the tools and data they need is fundamentally a **distributed systems problem**. This complexity mirrors the challenges faced in designing microservices, where components must communicate efficiently without creating bottlenecks or rigid dependencies.

Like microservices, agents must communicate efficiently and ensure their outputs are useful across the broader system. And like any service, their outputs shouldn't just loop back into the AI application — they should flow into other critical systems like data warehouses, CRMs, CDPs, and customer success platforms.

Sure, you could connect agents and tools through RPC and APIs, but that's a recipe for **tightly coupled systems**. Tight coupling makes it harder to scale, adapt, or support multiple consumers of the same data. Agents need flexibility. Their outputs must seamlessly feed into other agents, services, and platforms without locking everything into rigid dependencies.

### What's the Solution?

**Loose coupling through an event-driven architecture.** It's the backbone that allows agents to share information, act in real time, and integrate with the broader ecosystem — without the headaches of tight coupling.

---

## 📚 Event-Driven Architectures: A Primer

In the early days, software systems were monoliths. Everything lived in a single, tightly integrated codebase. While simple to build, monoliths became a nightmare as they grew.

Scaling was a blunt instrument: you had to scale the entire application, even if only one part needed it. This inefficiency led to bloated systems and brittle architectures that couldn't handle growth.

**Microservices changed this.**

By breaking applications into smaller, independently deployable components, teams could scale and update specific parts without touching the whole system. But this created a new challenge: how do all these smaller services communicate effectively?

If we connect services through direct RPC or API calls, we create a giant mess of interdependencies. If one service goes down, it impacts all nodes along the connected path.

**EDA solved the problem.**

Instead of tightly coupled, synchronous communication, EDA enables components to communicate asynchronously through events. Services don't wait on each other — they react to what's happening in real-time.

This approach made systems more resilient and adaptable, allowing them to handle the complexity of modern workflows. It wasn't just a technical breakthrough; it was a survival strategy for systems under pressure.

---

## ⚠️ The Rise and Fall of Early Social Giants

The rise and fall of early social networks like Friendster underscore the importance of scalable architecture. Friendster captured massive user bases early on, but their systems couldn't handle the demand. Performance issues drove users away, and the platform ultimately failed.

On the flip side, Facebook thrived not just because of its features but because it invested in scalable infrastructure. It didn't crumble under the weight of success — it rose to dominate.

**Today, we risk seeing a similar story play out with AI agents.**

Like early social networks, agents will experience rapid growth and adoption. Building agents isn't enough. The real question is whether your architecture can handle the complexity of distributed data, tool integrations, and multi-agent collaboration. Without the right foundation, your agent stack could fall apart just like the early casualties of social media.

---

## 🚀 The Future is Event-Driven Agents

The future of AI isn't just about building smarter agents — it's about creating systems that can evolve and scale as the technology advances. With the AI stack and underlying models changing rapidly, rigid designs quickly become barriers to innovation. To keep pace, we need architectures that prioritize flexibility, adaptability, and seamless integration. **EDA is the foundation for this future**, enabling agents to thrive in dynamic environments while remaining resilient and scalable.

---

## 🤝 Agents as Microservices with Informational Dependencies

Agents are similar to microservices: they're autonomous, decoupled, and capable of handling tasks independently. But agents go further.

While microservices typically process discrete operations, agents rely on shared, context-rich information to reason, make decisions, and collaborate. This creates unique demands for managing dependencies and ensuring real-time data flows.

For instance, an agent might pull customer data from a CRM, analyze live analytics, and use external tools — all while sharing updates with other agents. These interactions require a system where agents can work independently but still exchange critical information fluidly.

**EDA solves this challenge by acting as a "central nervous system" for data.** It allows agents to broadcast events asynchronously, ensuring that information flows dynamically without creating rigid dependencies. This decoupling lets agents operate autonomously while integrating seamlessly into broader workflows and systems.

---

## 🔓 Decoupling While Keeping Context Intact

Building flexible systems doesn't mean sacrificing context. Traditional, tightly coupled designs often bind workflows to specific pipelines or technologies, forcing teams to navigate bottlenecks and dependencies. Changes in one part of the stack ripple through the system, slowing innovation and scaling efforts.

**EDA eliminates these constraints.** By decoupling workflows and enabling asynchronous communication, EDA allows different parts of the stack — agents, data sources, tools, and application layers — to function independently.

Take today's AI stack, for example. MLOps teams manage pipelines like RAG, data scientists select models, and application developers build the interface and backend. A tightly coupled design forces all these teams into unnecessary interdependencies, slowing delivery and making it harder to adapt as new tools and techniques emerge.

In contrast, an event-driven system ensures that workflows stay loosely coupled, allowing each team to innovate independently.

Application layers don't need to understand the AI's internals — they simply consume results when needed. This decoupling also ensures AI insights don't remain siloed. Outputs from agents can seamlessly integrate into CRMs, CDPs, analytics tools, and more, creating a unified, adaptable ecosystem.

---

## ⚡ Scaling Agents with Event-Driven Architecture

**EDA is the backbone of this transition to agentic systems.**

Its ability to decouple workflows while enabling real-time communication ensures that agents can operate efficiently at scale. Platforms like Kafka exemplify the advantages of EDA in an agent-driven system:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Distributed design supports the addition of new agents or consumers without bottlenecks, ensuring the system grows effortlessly.
- **Low Latency**: Real-time event processing enables agents to respond instantly to changes, ensuring fast and reliable workflows.
- **Loose Coupling**: By communicating through topics rather than direct dependencies, agents remain independent and scalable.
- **Event Persistence**: Durable message storage guarantees that no data is lost in transit, which is critical for high-reliability workflows.

Data streaming enables the continuous flow of data throughout a business. A central nervous system acts as the unified backbone for real-time data flow, seamlessly connecting disparate systems, applications, and data sources to enable efficient agent communication and decision-making.

This architecture is a natural fit for frameworks like Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP).

MCP provides a universal standard for integrating AI systems with external tools, data sources, and applications, ensuring secure and seamless access to up-to-date information. By simplifying these connections, MCP reduces development effort while enabling context-aware decision-making.

**EDA addresses many of the challenges MCP aims to solve.** MCP requires seamless access to diverse data sources, real-time responsiveness, and scalability to support complex multi-agent workflows. By decoupling systems and enabling asynchronous communication, EDA simplifies integration and ensures agents can consume and produce events without rigid dependencies.

## 🎯 Event-Driven Agents Will Define the Future of AI

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and architectures must evolve with it.

And businesses are ready. A Forum Ventures survey found that 48% of senior IT leaders are prepared to integrate AI agents into operations, with 33% saying they're very prepared. This shows a clear demand for systems that can scale and handle complexity.

**EDA is the key to building agent systems that are flexible, resilient, and scalable.** It decouples components, enables real-time workflows, and ensures agents can integrate seamlessly into broader ecosystems.

Those who adopt EDA won't just survive — they'll gain a competitive edge in this new wave of AI innovation. The rest? They risk being left behind, casualties of their own inability to scale.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get OmniDaemon running in **5 minutes** with zero prior knowledge. Follow each step carefully.

---

### Step 1: Install Event Bus & Storage Backend

**For this Quick Start, we'll use Redis** (current production-ready backend for both event bus and storage).

> 💡 **OmniDaemon is pluggable!** Redis Streams is our first event bus implementation. Coming soon: Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS. For storage, we support JSON (dev) and Redis (production), with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and S3 planned.

#### macOS
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```

#### Windows
```bash
# Option 1: Using WSL (recommended)
wsl --install
# Then follow Ubuntu steps above

# Option 2: Download installer from https://redis.io/download
```

#### Docker (All Platforms - Easiest!)
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis:latest
```

**✅ Verify Event Bus is running (Redis Streams for this Quick Start):**
```bash
redis-cli ping
```
**Expected output:** `PONG`

❌ **If you see "command not found" or connection error**, the event bus backend isn't running. Try the Docker method above.

---

### Step 2: Install OmniDaemon

**⚡ Recommended: Using `uv` (Modern & Fast)**

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a blazing-fast Python package installer (10-100x faster than pip!):

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Or: pip install uv

# Create a new project
mkdir my-omnidaemon-project
cd my-omnidaemon-project

# Initialize project
uv init

# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install OmniDaemon
uv add omnidaemon

# Verify installation
python -c "import omnidaemon; print('✅ OmniDaemon installed!')"
```

**If installing from source with `uv`:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnirexflora-labs/OmniDaemon
cd OmniDaemon
uv sync  # Installs all dependencies
python -c "import omnidaemon; print('✅ OmniDaemon installed from source!')"
```

---

**Traditional Method: Using `pip`**

If you prefer the traditional approach:

```bash
# Create a new project folder
mkdir my-omnidaemon-project
cd my-omnidaemon-project

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install OmniDaemon
pip install omnidaemon

# Verify installation
python -c "import omnidaemon; print('✅ OmniDaemon installed!')"
```

**From source with `pip`:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnirexflora-labs/OmniDaemon
cd OmniDaemon
pip install -e .
python -c "import omnidaemon; print('✅ OmniDaemon installed from source!')"
```

---

### Step 3: Create Your First Agent

Create a file called `agent_runner.py` (this is your agent runner that registers and starts agents):

#### 📝 **Simple Version** (Minimal - Most Common)

```python
# agent_runner.py - SIMPLE VERSION
import asyncio
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK, AgentConfig

sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()

# CALLBACK = Where your AI agent runs!
# This function is called when a message arrives
async def greeter(message: dict):
    """
    This is YOUR callback - where your logic/AI agent executes.

    For this simple example, we just return a greeting.
    In real apps, this is where you'd call your AI agent.

    See real examples:
    - examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py (OmniCore)
    - examples/google_adk/agent_runner.py (Google ADK)
    """
    content = message.get("content", {})
    name = content.get("name", "stranger")
    return {"reply": f"Hello, {name}! 👋"}

async def main():
    # Register agent - only topic and callback are required!
    await sdk.register_agent(
        agent_config=AgentConfig(
            topic="greet.user",      # REQUIRED: Where to listen
            callback=greeter,         # REQUIRED: Your function (where AI agent runs)
        )
    )

    await sdk.start()
    print("🎧 Agent running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")

    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        await sdk.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**🤖 Understanding the Callback:**

The `callback` is **WHERE YOUR AI AGENT RUNS**. When a message arrives:
1. OmniDaemon calls your callback function
2. Your callback processes the message (with your AI agent or logic)
3. Your callback returns the result
4. OmniDaemon stores the result automatically

**What goes in the callback?**
- ✅ **OmniCore Agent** - See [OmniCore Example](#1-omnicore-agent-example)
- ✅ **Google ADK Agent** - See [Google ADK Example](#2-google-adk-agent-example)
- ✅ **LangChain Agent** - Any LangChain chain
- ✅ **Custom AI Agent** - Your own agent implementation
- ✅ **Plain Python** - Simple logic (but this is designed for AI agents!)

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with simple logic (like above), then add your AI agent later!

---

**Only 2 things are required:**
1. ✅ `topic` - Where your agent listens
2. ✅ `callback` - Your function (where AI agent runs)

**Everything else has smart defaults:**
- `name` → Auto-generated (e.g., `agent-abc123`)
- `tools` → Empty list `[]`
- `description` → Empty string `""`
- `config` → Consumer count: 1, retries: 3, reclaim: 60s

---

#### ⚙️ **Full Version** (All Options - Production Ready)

```python
# agent_runner.py - FULL VERSION with all options
import asyncio
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK, AgentConfig, SubscriptionConfig

sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()

async def greeter(message: dict):
    content = message.get("content", {})
    name = content.get("name", "stranger")
    print(f"📨 Processing request for: {name}")
    return {"reply": f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to OmniDaemon. 🎉"}

async def main():
    try:
        # Register with ALL optional parameters
        await sdk.register_agent(
            agent_config=AgentConfig(
                name="GREETER_AGENT",              # Optional: Custom name
                topic="greet.user",                # REQUIRED
                callback=greeter,                   # REQUIRED
                description="Friendly greeting agent",  # Optional
                tools=["greeting", "chat"],         # Optional: Tool names
                config=SubscriptionConfig(          # Optional: Advanced settings
                    reclaim_idle_ms=60000,          # Optional: 60s (default varies)
                    dlq_retry_limit=3,              # Optional: 3 retries (default)
                    consumer_count=2,               # Optional: 2 parallel consumers
                ),
            )
        )

        print("✅ Agent registered!")
        await sdk.start()
        print("🎧 Listening for events...")

        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n👋 Shutting down...")
    finally:
        await sdk.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Use full version when:**
- ✅ Need custom agent names for monitoring
- ✅ Need more than 1 parallel consumer (scaling)
- ✅ Need custom retry/reclaim settings
- ✅ Want descriptive metadata for docs

---

**💡 Quick Comparison:**

| Parameter | Required? | Simple Version | Full Version | Default if Not Set |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `topic` | ✅ **YES** | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| `callback` | ✅ **YES** | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| `name` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `agent-<uuid>` |
| `description` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `""` |
| `tools` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `[]` |
| `config` | No | ❌ | ✅ | See below |

**Default Config Values:**
- `consumer_count`: 1 (single consumer)
- `dlq_retry_limit`: 3 attempts
- `reclaim_idle_ms`: Varies by event bus

**👉 Start with Simple Version, add options later as needed!**

---

#### 🤖 **Real AI Agent Callbacks** (How Pros Do It)

Here's how the callback looks with ACTUAL AI agents:

**Example 1: With OmniCore Agent**
```python
from omnicoreagent import OmniAgent

# Initialize your AI agent
agent = OmniAgent(
    name="my_agent",
    system_instruction="Help users with tasks",
    model_config={"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o"},
)

# Callback = where you run your AI agent
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    content = message.get("content", "")

    # THIS is where your AI agent runs!
    result = await agent.run(content)

    return {"status": "success", "data": result}
```

**Example 2: With Google ADK Agent**
```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.runners import Runner

# Initialize your AI agent
agent = LlmAgent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    name="my_agent",
    instruction="Help users with tasks",
)
runner = Runner(agent=agent, app_name="my_app", session_service=session_service)

# Callback = where you run your AI agent
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    query = message.get("content", "")

    # THIS is where your AI agent runs!
    async for event in runner.run_async(user_id="user", session_id="session", new_message=query):
        if event.is_final_response():
            return event.content.parts[0].text
```

**Example 3: Plain Python (Simple Logic)**
```python
# Callback = any Python logic
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    # No AI agent - just process data
    data = message.get("content", {})
    result = process_data(data)  # Your custom logic
    return {"processed": result}
```

**💡 The Pattern:**
1. Initialize your AI agent **outside** the callback (once)
2. In callback: Extract message content
3. In callback: Run your AI agent with that content
4. In callback: Return the result
5. OmniDaemon handles the rest (storage, retries, DLQ, etc.)

---

#### 📦 **What's Inside the Message?**

**IMPORTANT:** The `message` parameter contains the **FULL EventEnvelope**, not just content!

```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    """
    The 'message' parameter contains EVERYTHING from the publisher:
    - content (your data)
    - correlation_id (track requests)
    - tenant_id (multi-tenancy)
    - source (event origin)
    - causation_id (event chain)
    - webhook (callback URL)
    - reply_to (response topic)
    - created_at (timestamp)
    - etc.
    """

    # Access any field from the EventEnvelope
    content = message.get("content", {})           # Your data
    correlation_id = message.get("correlation_id")  # Request tracking
    tenant_id = message.get("tenant_id")           # Which tenant?
    source = message.get("source")                 # Where from?
    causation_id = message.get("causation_id")     # What caused this?
    reply_to = message.get("reply_to")             # Response topic
    webhook = message.get("webhook")               # Callback URL

    # Use metadata to make smart decisions!
    # ... (see examples below)
```

**Why This Matters:**
You can use this metadata to:
- ✅ Filter by tenant (multi-tenancy)
- ✅ Route by source (different logic per channel)
- ✅ Make decisions based on correlation chain
- ✅ Check if response needed (reply_to exists?)
- ✅ Conditional processing based on causation
- ✅ Custom logic per event metadata

---

#### 🎯 **Smart Callback Patterns**

**Pattern 1: Multi-Tenant Filtering**
```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    tenant_id = message.get("tenant_id")

    # Only process if specific tenant
    if tenant_id not in ["tenant-123", "tenant-456"]:
        return {"status": "skipped", "reason": "unauthorized tenant"}

    # Load tenant-specific config
    tenant_config = get_tenant_config(tenant_id)
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Process with your AI agent (adapt to your agent's API)
    result = await process_with_agent(content, config=tenant_config)
    return {"status": "success", "data": result, "tenant": tenant_id}
```

**Pattern 2: Source-Based Routing**
```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    source = message.get("source")
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Different logic based on source
    if source == "web-app":
        # Web users get full processing
        result = await process_with_agent(content)
    elif source == "mobile-app":
        # Mobile gets optimized processing
        result = await process_with_agent(content, optimized=True)
    elif source == "api":
        # API gets raw data
        result = await process_with_agent(content, raw=True)
    else:
        # Default behavior
        result = await process_with_agent(content)

    return {"status": "success", "data": result, "processed_by": source}
```

**Pattern 3: Correlation-Based Decisions**
```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    correlation_id = message.get("correlation_id")
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Check if this is part of ongoing conversation
    if correlation_id:
        # Load conversation context from your DB
        context = await load_conversation_context(correlation_id)
        result = await process_with_agent(content, context=context)

        # Save updated context
        await save_conversation_context(correlation_id, result)
    else:
        # New conversation
        result = await process_with_agent(content)

    return {"status": "success", "data": result, "correlation_id": correlation_id}
```

**Pattern 4: Causation Chain Processing**
```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    causation_id = message.get("causation_id")
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Check what caused this event
    if causation_id:
        # Load parent event
        parent_event = await get_event(causation_id)

        # Process differently based on parent
        if parent_event.get("type") == "user_action":
            priority = "high"
        elif parent_event.get("type") == "scheduled_task":
            priority = "normal"
        else:
            priority = "low"

        result = await process_with_agent(content, priority=priority)
    else:
        # No parent event
        result = await process_with_agent(content)

    return {"status": "success", "data": result}
```

> 💡 **Note**: `process_with_agent()` is a placeholder. Replace with your actual AI agent's API.
> **See real examples**: `examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py` or `examples/google_adk/agent_runner.py`

**Pattern 5: Conditional Response Routing**
```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    content = message.get("content", {})
    reply_to = message.get("reply_to")
    webhook = message.get("webhook")

    # Process the task with your AI agent
    result = await process_with_agent(content)

    # Smart response handling
    response = {"status": "success", "data": result}

    if reply_to:
        # Response will auto-publish to reply_to topic
        # Another agent can pick it up there
        response["note"] = f"Will be published to {reply_to}"

    if webhook:
        # Response will be POSTed to webhook
        # Your API will receive it
        response["note"] = f"Will be sent to {webhook}"

    # You can also add custom routing logic
    if result.get("needs_review"):
        # Publish to review queue
        await sdk.publish_task(
            EventEnvelope(
                topic="review.queue",
                payload=PayloadBase(content=result)
            )
        )
        response["routed_to_review"] = True

    return response
```

**Pattern 6: Complete Smart Callback**
```python
async def my_callback(message: dict):
    """
    Production-grade callback that uses all metadata
    to make intelligent routing decisions.
    """
    # Extract all metadata
    content = message.get("content", {})
    tenant_id = message.get("tenant_id")
    source = message.get("source")
    correlation_id = message.get("correlation_id")

    # 1. Tenant validation
    if tenant_id and not await is_tenant_authorized(tenant_id):
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error": "Unauthorized tenant",
            "tenant_id": tenant_id
        }

    # 2. Load tenant-specific config
    config = await get_tenant_config(tenant_id) if tenant_id else {}

    # 3. Check rate limits by source
    if source and await is_rate_limited(source, tenant_id):
        return {
            "status": "rate_limited",
            "retry_after": 60,
            "source": source
        }

    # 4. Load conversation context if correlated
    context = None
    if correlation_id:
        context = await load_context(correlation_id)

    # 5. Process with your AI agent (adapt to your agent's API)
    result = await process_with_agent(
        content,
        config=config,
        context=context,
        metadata={"tenant_id": tenant_id, "source": source}
    )

    # 6. Save context for next message
    if correlation_id:
        await save_context(correlation_id, result)

    # 7. Return enriched response
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "data": result,
        "metadata": {
            "tenant_id": tenant_id,
            "source": source,
            "correlation_id": correlation_id,
            "processed_at": time.time()
        }
    }
```

> 💡 **Note**: All examples use `process_with_agent()` as a placeholder.
> **Replace with actual agent API**: See `examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py` or `examples/google_adk/agent_runner.py`

**🎓 Key Insights:**

1. **Message = Full Event** - Not just content, ALL metadata included
2. **Use Metadata Smartly** - Filter, route, prioritize based on metadata
3. **Multi-Tenancy** - Use `tenant_id` to isolate and configure
4. **Source Routing** - Different logic for web vs mobile vs API
5. **Conversation Context** - Use `correlation_id` to maintain context
6. **Event Chains** - Use `causation_id` to understand event history
7. **Response Routing** - Check `reply_to` and `webhook` for smart routing

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start simple (just use `content`), then add metadata-based logic as your system grows!

### Step 4: Run Your Agent

```bash
python agent_runner.py
```

**✅ You should see output like this:**
```
✅ Agent registered successfully!
[Runner abc-123] Registered agent 'GREETER_AGENT' on topic 'greet.user'
🎧 Agent is now listening for events. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

**✅ Success indicators:**
- "Agent registered successfully!" message
- Shows "[Runner ...] Registered agent" with your agent name
- Shows "listening for events" message
- Process doesn't exit (stays running, waiting for messages)

**❌ Common errors and fixes:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Connection refused [Errno 111]` | Event bus not running | Go back to Step 1, start event bus backend |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'omnidaemon'` | Not installed | Go back to Step 2 |
| `ImportError: cannot import name 'OmniDaemonSDK'` | Wrong import | Try `from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK` |

**Keep this terminal running** - your agent is now alive and listening!

---

### Step 5: Test Your Agent

**Open a NEW terminal** (keep agent running in first terminal).

#### 📝 **Simple Version** (Minimal - Quickest)

```bash
# Create publisher.py
cat > publisher.py << 'EOF'
import asyncio
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK
from omnidaemon import EventEnvelope, PayloadBase

sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()

async def main():
    # SIMPLE: Only topic and content required!
    event = EventEnvelope(
        topic="greet.user",              # REQUIRED
        payload=PayloadBase(
            content={"name": "Alice"}     # REQUIRED
        ),
    )

    task_id = await sdk.publish_task(event_envelope=event)
    print(f"📨 Task ID: {task_id}")

    # Wait and get result
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    result = await sdk.get_result(task_id)
    print(f"✅ Result: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
EOF

python publisher.py
```

**That's it!** Only 2 things required:
1. ✅ `topic` - Where to send the message
2. ✅ `content` - Your data (can be dict, string, or JSON)

**Everything else is auto-generated:**
- `id` → UUID (e.g., `abc-123-def`)
- `created_at` → Current timestamp
- `webhook` → `None`
- `reply_to` → `None`

---

#### ⚙️ **Full Version** (All Options - Production)

```bash
# Create publisher_full.py
cat > publisher_full.py << 'EOF'
import asyncio
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK
from omnidaemon import EventEnvelope, PayloadBase

sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()

async def main():
    # FULL: All optional parameters
    event = EventEnvelope(
        topic="greet.user",                # REQUIRED: Agent's listening topic

        payload=PayloadBase(
            content={"name": "Alice", "lang": "en"},    # REQUIRED: Your data

            webhook="https://myapp.com/callback",       # Optional: HTTP callback
            # When task completes, OmniDaemon sends POST request to this URL
            # with the result. Great for async notifications to your API!

            reply_to="greet.response",                  # Optional: Chain agents
            # Result is published to this topic. Another agent can listen here
            # and process the result. Perfect for agent chaining/workflows!
        ),

        # Optional: Multi-tenancy isolation
        tenant_id="tenant-123",
        # Isolate data by tenant in multi-tenant systems

        # Optional: Request tracking across services
        correlation_id="req-456",
        # Track this request across multiple services/agents
        # Same ID flows through entire request chain

        # Optional: Causation tracking (what caused what)
        causation_id="cause-789",
        # Track what caused this event (previous event ID)
        # Build causality chains: Event A → Event B → Event C

        # Optional: Event source identification
        source="web-app",
        # Where did this event originate? (web-app, mobile-app, cron-job, etc.)
    )

    task_id = await sdk.publish_task(event_envelope=event)
    print(f"📨 Published: {task_id}")
    print(f"   Webhook: Will POST result to https://myapp.com/callback")
    print(f"   Reply to: Result will be published to '{event.payload.reply_to}' topic")
    print(f"   Correlation: {event.correlation_id}")

    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    result = await sdk.get_result(task_id)
    print(f"✅ Result: {result}")
    print(f"\n💡 Note: Results stored for 24 hours, then auto-deleted for storage efficiency")

asyncio.run(main())
EOF

python publisher_full.py
```

---

#### 📖 **Understanding Each Parameter**

**🔗 `webhook` - HTTP Callback (Async Notification)**
```python
webhook="https://myapp.com/callback"
```
**What happens:**
1. Agent processes your task
2. OmniDaemon sends **HTTP POST** to your webhook URL
3. Request body contains the task result
4. Your API receives notification without polling!

**Example webhook handler (FastAPI):**
```python
@app.post("/callback")
async def handle_result(result: dict):
    task_id = result.get("task_id")
    data = result.get("data")
    print(f"Task {task_id} completed: {data}")
    # Process result in your system
```

**Use when:** You want async notifications to your API (no polling needed!)

---

**🔄 `reply_to` - Agent Chaining (Publish Result to Another Topic)**
```python
reply_to="greet.response"
```
**What happens:**
1. Agent processes your task
2. Result is **published to `reply_to` topic**
3. Another agent listening on that topic receives it
4. Perfect for multi-agent workflows!

**Example agent chain:**
```python
# Agent 1: Process user input
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="process.user.input",
        callback=process_input,
    )
)

# Agent 2: Handle processed result
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="process.result",  # ← Listening here!
        callback=handle_result,
    )
)

# Publish with reply_to
event = EventEnvelope(
    topic="process.user.input",
    payload=PayloadBase(
        content={"text": "Hello"},
        reply_to="process.result",  # ← Result goes here!
    ),
)
```

**Use when:** Building agent workflows (Agent A → Agent B → Agent C)

---

**⏱️ Result Storage (24-Hour TTL)**
```
Results are automatically stored for 24 hours, then deleted.
```
**Why 24 hours?**
- ✅ Enough time to retrieve results
- ✅ Prevents storage from growing unbounded
- ✅ Automatic cleanup (no manual management)
- ✅ Efficient storage management

**What this means:**
- ✅ Call `get_result(task_id)` within 24 hours - works fine
- ❌ Call `get_result(task_id)` after 24 hours - result is gone

**If you need longer:**
- Store results in your own database after retrieval
- Use webhooks to get notified immediately
- Use `reply_to` to chain to a storage agent

---

**🔍 `correlation_id` - Request Tracking**
```python
correlation_id="req-456"
```
**What it does:**
- Tracks a request across multiple services/agents
- Same ID flows through entire request chain
- Perfect for distributed tracing

**Example flow:**
```
User Request → API (correlation_id: req-456)
            → Agent 1 (correlation_id: req-456)
            → Agent 2 (correlation_id: req-456)
            → Database (correlation_id: req-456)
```

**Use when:**
- Debugging distributed systems
- Tracing requests across services
- Building observability dashboards

---

**🔗 `causation_id` - Causality Tracking**
```python
causation_id="cause-789"
```
**What it does:**
- Tracks what **caused** this event
- Build causality chains

**Example chain:**
```
Event A (id: cause-789)
  ↓ causes
Event B (causation_id: cause-789, id: effect-123)
  ↓ causes
Event C (causation_id: effect-123, id: final-456)
```

**Use when:**
- Event sourcing patterns
- Audit trails
- Understanding event dependencies

---

**📍 `source` - Event Origin**
```python
source="web-app"
```
**What it does:**
- Identifies where event came from
- Useful for filtering/routing

**Examples:**
- `source="web-app"` - From web frontend
- `source="mobile-app"` - From mobile app
- `source="cron-job"` - From scheduled task
- `source="webhook"` - From external webhook

**Use when:**
- Multi-channel systems
- Analytics/metrics by source
- Different processing per source

---

**🏢 `tenant_id` - Multi-Tenancy**
```python
tenant_id="tenant-123"
```
**What it does:**
- Isolates data by tenant
- Each tenant's data stays separate

**Use when:**
- SaaS products with multiple customers
- Each customer needs data isolation
- Compliance/security requirements

---

**💡 Pro Tips:**

1. **Start Simple** - Only use `topic` and `content` initially
2. **Add Webhook** - When you need async notifications
3. **Add reply_to** - When building agent chains
4. **Add correlation_id** - When debugging distributed issues
5. **Add tenant_id** - When building multi-tenant SaaS

**Most common pattern (80% of use cases):**
```python
event = EventEnvelope(
    topic="my.topic",
    payload=PayloadBase(content={"data": "..."})
)
```

**Production pattern with webhooks:**
```python
event = EventEnvelope(
    topic="my.topic",
    payload=PayloadBase(
        content={"data": "..."},
        webhook="https://myapi.com/callback",  # Get notified!
    ),
    correlation_id=request_id,  # Track it!
)
```

---

**📊 Quick Reference Table:**

| Parameter | Required? | Simple | Full | Default | What It Does |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------|---------|--------------|
| **EventEnvelope:** |
| `topic` | ✅ **YES** | ✅ | ✅ | - | Where to send message |
| `payload` | ✅ **YES** | ✅ | ✅ | - | Your data + options |
| `id` | No | ❌ | ❌ | Auto-UUID | Unique message ID |
| `created_at` | No | ❌ | ❌ | `time.time()` | Message timestamp |
| `tenant_id` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `None` | Multi-tenancy isolation |
| `correlation_id` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `None` | Track requests across services |
| `causation_id` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `None` | Track event causality chain |
| `source` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `None` | Event origin (web, mobile, etc.) |
| **PayloadBase:** |
| `content` | ✅ **YES** | ✅ | ✅ | - | Your task data |
| `webhook` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `None` | HTTP POST callback URL |
| `reply_to` | No | ❌ | ✅ | `None` | Publish result to topic (chaining) |

**⏱️ Result Storage:**
- Results stored for **24 hours** (TTL)
- Automatic cleanup for storage efficiency
- Use `webhook` or `reply_to` if you need longer retention

---

#### Option C: Using CLI (If Available)
```bash
# Simple
omnidaemon task publish --topic greet.user --payload '{"name":"Alice"}'

# With webhook
omnidaemon task publish --topic greet.user --payload '{"name":"Alice"}' --webhook https://myapp.com/callback
```

**✅ Expected output:**
```
📨 Published task: msg-1234567890-0
✅ Result: {'reply': 'Hello, Alice! Welcome to OmniDaemon. 🎉'}
```

**In your agent terminal (first terminal)**, you'll see:
```
📨 Received greeting request for: Alice
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** Your agent just processed its first event!

---

### Step 6: Verify Everything Works

Let's check system health:

```bash
# Create health_check.py
cat > health_check.py << 'EOF'
import asyncio
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK

async def main():
    sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()
    health = await sdk.health()

    print("\n🏥 System Health Check")
    print("=" * 50)
    print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
    print(f"Registered Agents: {health['registered_agents_count']}")
    print(f"Subscribed Topics: {health['subscribed_topics']}")
    print(f"Event Bus: {health['event_bus_type']}")
    print(f"Storage Healthy: {health['storage_healthy']}")
    print("=" * 50)

    if health['status'] == 'running':
        print("✅ All systems operational!")
    else:
        print(f"⚠️  System status: {health['status']}")

asyncio.run(main())
EOF

python health_check.py
```

**✅ Expected output:**
```
🏥 System Health Check
==================================================
Status: running
Registered Agents: 1
Subscribed Topics: ['greet.user']
Event Bus: RedisStreamEventBus (Pluggable - using Redis Streams)
Storage: Healthy (Pluggable - using Redis)
==================================================
✅ All systems operational!
```

---

### 🎉 Success! What Just Happened?

You now have a **fully functional event-driven AI agent runtime**:

1. ✅ **Event Bus** - Running and handling message distribution (using Redis Streams)
2. ✅ **Storage Backend** - Persisting agents, results, and metrics (using Redis)
3. ✅ **OmniDaemon** - Installed and operational
4. ✅ **Agent** - Registered and listening for events
5. ✅ **Event Flow** - Published task → Agent processed → Result stored
6. ✅ **Health Check** - All systems verified

**The Event Flow:**
```
Publisher (you)
   │
   ├─► Publishes to topic "greet.user"
   │
   ▼
Event Bus (Redis Streams)
   │   (Pluggable: Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS coming soon)
   │
   ├─► Notifies all subscribers
   │
   ▼
Your Agent (greeter)
   │
   ├─► Processes message
   ├─► Generates response
   │
   ▼
Storage Backend (Redis)
   │   (Pluggable: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3 coming soon)
   │
   └─► Stores result for retrieval
```

---

### ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

The Quick Start uses smart defaults - **you don't need to configure anything!**

**Defaults:**
- Storage Backend: JSON files in `.omnidaemon_data/` (pluggable)
- Event Bus: Redis Streams at `localhost:6379` (pluggable)
- API: Disabled (use SDK/CLI only)

**To customize**, create a `.env` file:

```bash
# .env
# Storage Backend (pluggable: json, redis, postgresql*, mongodb*, s3*)
STORAGE_BACKEND=redis              # Production: Use Redis for distributed storage
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379   # Connection string for Redis backend

# Event Bus (pluggable: redis_stream, kafka*, rabbitmq*, nats*)
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=redis_stream        # Production-ready option (more coming soon)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379   # Connection string for Redis Streams

# API Server
OMNIDAEMON_API_ENABLED=true        # Enable HTTP API server
OMNIDAEMON_API_PORT=8765           # API port

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                     # DEBUG for troubleshooting

# * = Coming soon
```

**When to change defaults:**

| Setting | Change When... |
|---------|----------------|
| `STORAGE_BACKEND=redis` | Production deployment, need distributed storage |
| `REDIS_URL=...` | Event bus or storage on different host/port |
| `OMNIDAEMON_API_ENABLED=true` | Want HTTP API access |
| `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` | Troubleshooting issues |

**For Quick Start**: Stick with defaults! 👍

---

### 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

#### Problem: "Event Bus connection keeps failing"
```bash
# For Redis Streams backend (default):
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping

# Check Redis is on default port
redis-cli -p 6379 ping

# If using custom port, set it
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380
python agent_runner.py

# For other event bus backends (when available):
# Check EVENT_BUS_TYPE in your .env matches your running backend
```

#### Problem: "Agent runs but doesn't process tasks"
```bash
# Verify agent registered
python -c "
import asyncio
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK
agents = asyncio.run(OmniDaemonSDK().list_agents())
print(f'Registered agents: {agents}')
"

# Check event bus streams (if using Redis Streams)
redis-cli XLEN omni-stream:greet.user
```

#### Problem: "No output when running agent"
**This is normal!** Agent runs in background. Look for:
- ✅ "Registered agent" message
- ✅ "Listening for topics" message
- ✅ No error messages

#### Problem: "Can't import OmniDaemonSDK"
```python
# Try alternative import
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK

# Or check if installed
pip list | grep omnidaemon
```

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🔁 Event-Driven, Not Request-Driven

**Traditional (Request-Driven)**:
```
User → HTTP Request → Agent → Response → Done
```

**OmniDaemon (Event-Driven)**:
```
Event Published → Event Bus → Agent Consumes → Process → Store Result
                  (Redis Streams)    ↓
                               Multiple Agents Listen
                               Asynchronous Execution
                               Automatic Retries
                               DLQ for Failures
```

**Key Differences**:
- Agents **subscribe to topics**, not HTTP endpoints
- Tasks are **published as events**, not API calls
- Execution is **asynchronous and decoupled**
- Built-in **durability and fault tolerance**

---

### 🧩 Framework Agnostic

Your agent can be **anything**:
- 🤖 **OmniCore Agent** - Complete AI agent framework with MCP tools
- 🔧 **Google ADK** - Google's Agent Development Kit
- 🦜 **LangChain** - Popular LLM orchestration framework
- 🤝 **AutoGen** - Multi-agent collaboration framework
- 🦙 **LlamaIndex** - Data-augmented LLM apps
- 👥 **CrewAI** - Agent collaboration framework
- 🐍 **Plain Python** - Any callable that accepts a `Dict`

**OmniDaemon only requires**:
```python
async def your_agent(payload: dict) -> dict:
    # Your logic here
    return {"result": "..."}
```

---

### ⚙️ Pluggable Architecture

#### How Pluggability Works

**The Simple Truth:** You provide the URL/connection string, OmniDaemon handles ALL the implementation!

```python
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK

# Your code stays the SAME regardless of backend!
sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()  # Auto-configured via environment variables
await sdk.register_agent(...)
await sdk.publish_task(...)
```

**Example: Switching Event Bus Backends**

```bash
# Using Redis Streams (default)
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=redis_stream
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Switch to RabbitMQ (when available) - SAME CODE!
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=rabbitmq
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost:5672

# Switch to Kafka (when available) - SAME CODE!
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=kafka
KAFKA_SERVERS=localhost:9092
```

**Example: Switching Storage Backends**

```bash
# Local JSON files (development)
STORAGE_BACKEND=json
JSON_STORAGE_DIR=.omnidaemon_data

# Switch to Redis (production) - SAME CODE!
STORAGE_BACKEND=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Switch to PostgreSQL (when available) - SAME CODE!
STORAGE_BACKEND=postgresql
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/omnidaemon

# Switch to MongoDB (when available) - SAME CODE!
STORAGE_BACKEND=mongodb

```

> 🔥 **Key Point:** Your agent code **NEVER changes**. Just update environment variables, and OmniDaemon handles the rest - connection pooling, retries, serialization, health checks, everything!

#### Dependency Injection Pattern

OmniDaemon uses **Dependency Injection** - the event bus and storage are pre-configured and injected automatically:

```python
from omnidaemon import OmniDaemonSDK

# No manual instantiation needed!
# Event bus and storage are configured via environment variables
# and injected automatically when you create the SDK
sdk = OmniDaemonSDK()

# Behind the scenes, OmniDaemon:
# 1. Reads EVENT_BUS_TYPE and STORAGE_BACKEND from environment
# 2. Loads the appropriate backend class
# 3. Connects using the provided URL/connection string
# 4. Injects it into the SDK
#
# You just use the SDK - simple! 🎉
```

#### Supported Backends

**Event Bus (Messaging)**:
| Backend | Status | Configuration |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Redis Streams | ✅ **Production-ready** | `EVENT_BUS_TYPE=redis_stream` + `REDIS_URL=...` |
| Kafka | 🚧 Coming soon | `EVENT_BUS_TYPE=kafka` + `KAFKA_SERVERS=...` |
| RabbitMQ | 🚧 Coming soon | `EVENT_BUS_TYPE=rabbitmq` + `RABBITMQ_URL=...` |
| NATS JetStream | 🚧 Coming soon | `EVENT_BUS_TYPE=nats` + `NATS_URL=...` |

**Storage (Persistence)**:
| Backend | Status | Configuration |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| JSON | ✅ **Development** | `STORAGE_BACKEND=json` + `JSON_STORAGE_DIR=...` |
| Redis | ✅ **Production-ready** | `STORAGE_BACKEND=redis` + `REDIS_URL=...` |
| PostgreSQL | 🚧 Coming soon | `STORAGE_BACKEND=postgresql` + `POSTGRES_URL=...` |
| MongoDB | 🚧 Coming soon | `STORAGE_BACKEND=mongodb` + `MONGODB_URI=...` |

> 💡 **That's it!** No code changes. No imports. No complex configuration. Just set env vars and go!

### Key Components

1. **Event Bus (Pluggable)** - Message broker for event distribution. Currently: Redis Streams. Coming: Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS.
2. **Storage (Pluggable)** - Persistent layer for agents, results, metrics. Currently: Redis, JSON. Coming: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3.
3. **Agent Runner** - Orchestrates agent execution and lifecycle
4. **CLI** - Beautiful command-line interface (powered by Rich)
5. **API** - RESTful HTTP API (powered by FastAPI)
6. **SDK** - Python SDK for agent integration

> 💡 **Swap backends anytime** via environment variables - no code changes needed!

### 3. Content Moderation Pipeline (OmniCore Agent + SQLite)

**Goal:** Automate moderation of filesystem content, flag policy violations, and persist outcomes for BI dashboards.

- **Agents:** `examples/content_moderation/agent_runner.py`
  - `CONTENT_MODERATION_AGENT` – OmniCore agent with filesystem MCP tool + rich moderation toolkit
  - `CONTENT_MODERATION_REVIEW_AGENT` – Stores moderation results in SQLite
- **Publisher:** `examples/content_moderation/publisher.py`
- **Topics:**
  - Input: `content_moderation.tasks`
  - Review: `content_moderation.review`
- **Data store:** `~/.omniagent/moderation.db` (auto-created)

```bash
# Terminal 1 – start the OmniCore agents (moderation + review archiver)
uv run python examples/content_moderation/agent_runner.py

# Option A – continuous watch over selected directories (polling)
uv run python examples/content_moderation/publisher.py --directories ~/Projects ~/Docs --watch --interval 5

# Option B – native filesystem events (requires watchdog)
uv pip install watchdog prometheus-client
uv run python examples/content_moderation/publisher.py --directories ~/Projects --watch --watchdog

# Option C – manual cycle or targeted file scans
uv run python examples/content_moderation/publisher.py                          # default directories
uv run python examples/content_moderation/publisher.py --directories ~/Projects # one-off diff
uv run python examples/content_moderation/publisher.py --task single_file --file ~/Docs/post.txt

# Programmatic ingestion (copy + publish single file)
uv run python examples/content_moderation/ingest.py ~/Docs/post.txt --metadata '{"tenant":"acme"}'

# Inspect moderation output
omnidaemon task list --topic content_moderation.review
sqlite3 ~/.omniagent/moderation.db 'SELECT * FROM moderation_reviews ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;'
```

**Highlights:**
- OmniCore agents leverage custom Python tooling (spam/profanity detection, PII checks, hate-speech heuristics, SQLite logging, quarantine handling) and automatically gain access to the ingest workspace.
- `publisher.py` supports a continuous watcher (polling or watchdog). New or modified files are copied into `~/.omniagent/moderation_ingest/` before schema-validated events are published to the moderation topic.
- `ingest.py` exposes a simple API-friendly entry point for services that want to push individual files into the moderation flow.
- All events/decisions are validated via `ModerationEvent` / `ModerationDecision` (Pydantic) before reaching the agents.
- Prometheus metrics (`content_moderation_events_total`, `...decisions_total`, etc.) are available when `prometheus-client` is installed and `CONTENT_MODERATION_METRICS_PORT` is set.
- `reply_to` automatically routes agent responses to the review topic, where the second OmniCore agent archives results via the `record_moderation_result` tool.
- Extend with dashboards (Superset, Metabase) or escalation workflows using the SQLite tables.

## 🎯 Common Patterns

Production-ready patterns you can copy and use immediately.

### Pattern 1: Multi-Tenant Agent

Process requests for different tenants with isolated configs:

```python
async def multi_tenant_agent(message: dict):
    tenant_id = message.get("tenant_id")
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Load tenant-specific config
    config = await get_tenant_config(tenant_id)

    # Process with your AI agent
    # (Replace with your actual agent's run method)
    result = await process_with_agent(content, config)

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "data": result,
        "tenant_id": tenant_id
    }
```

**See real implementation**: `examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py`

### Pattern 2: Agent Chain (Workflow)

Chain multiple agents for multi-step processing:

```python
# Agent 1: Extract text from document
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="document.process",
        callback=extract_text,
    )
)

# Agent 2: Summarize extracted text
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="text.summarize",
        callback=summarize_text,
    )
)

# Publish with reply_to for chaining
event = EventEnvelope(
    topic="document.process",
    payload=PayloadBase(
        content={"doc_url": "https://..."},
        reply_to="text.summarize",  # Result → next agent
    ),
)
```

### Pattern 3: Fan-Out Processing

Multiple agents process the same event in parallel:

```python
# Agent A: Image processing
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="media.uploaded",
        name="image-processor",
        callback=process_image,
    )
)

# Agent B: Metadata extraction
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="media.uploaded",
        name="metadata-extractor",
        callback=extract_metadata,
    )
)

# Agent C: Thumbnail generation
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="media.uploaded",
        name="thumbnail-generator",
        callback=generate_thumbnail,
    )
)

# One event → All three agents process it!
```

### Pattern 4: Priority Routing

Route by source for different processing logic:

```python
async def priority_agent(message: dict):
    source = message.get("source")
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Different logic per source
    if source == "premium-user":
        # Premium users get faster processing
        priority = "high"
        timeout = 30
    elif source == "trial-user":
        priority = "normal"
        timeout = 60
    else:
        priority = "low"
        timeout = 120

    # Process with your AI agent (adapt to your agent's API)
    # See examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py for real implementation
    result = await process_with_agent(content, priority=priority, timeout=timeout)

    return {"status": "success", "data": result, "source": source}
```

**See real implementation**: `examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py`

### Pattern 5: Long-Running with Webhook

Notify your API when long task completes:

```python
# Your agent runner (long-running AI task)
async def analyze_video(message: dict):
    video_url = message.get("content", {}).get("url")

    # Long-running AI processing (30 seconds+)
    analysis = await ai_agent.analyze_video(video_url)

    return {"analysis": analysis}

# Publisher (with webhook)
event = EventEnvelope(
    topic="video.analyze",
    payload=PayloadBase(
        content={"url": "https://..."},
        webhook="https://myapi.com/video-complete",  # Get notified!
    ),
)

# Your API receives POST when done:
@app.post("/video-complete")
async def handle_video_result(result: dict):
    # Process result in your system
    print(f"Video analysis complete: {result}")
```

### Pattern 6: Conversation Context

Maintain context across multiple messages:

```python
async def conversational_agent(message: dict):
    correlation_id = message.get("correlation_id")
    content = message.get("content", {})

    # Load conversation history
    if correlation_id:
        context = await db.get_conversation(correlation_id)
    else:
        context = []

    # Add user message
    user_text = content.get("text")
    context.append({"role": "user", "content": user_text})

    # Process with your AI agent (adapt to your agent's API)
    # For OmniCore: await agent.run(user_text)
    # For Google ADK: runner.run_async(user_id, session_id, new_message)
    response = await process_with_agent(user_text, context=context)

    # Save updated context
    context.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
    await db.save_conversation(correlation_id, context)

    return {"reply": response, "correlation_id": correlation_id}
```

**See real implementation**: `examples/google_adk/agent_runner.py` (uses session_service)

### Pattern 7: Retry with Custom Logic

Handle retries intelligently:

```python
async def smart_retry_agent(message: dict):
    content = message.get("content", {})
    retry_count = content.get("_retry_count", 0)

    try:
        # Process with your AI agent
        result = await process_with_agent(content)
        return {"status": "success", "data": result}
    except TemporaryError as e:
        # Retriable error (network, rate limits, etc.)
        if retry_count < 3:
            content["_retry_count"] = retry_count + 1
            # OmniDaemon will auto-retry
            raise
        else:
            # Max retries → goes to DLQ
            return {"status": "failed", "error": str(e)}
    except PermanentError as e:
        # Non-retriable error (invalid input, etc.)
        return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
```

**Note**: OmniDaemon automatically retries failed tasks (default: 3 retries). This pattern shows how to add custom retry logic on top.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Environment Variables

Configure OmniDaemon via environment variables (use `.env` file or export):

### Core Configuration

```bash
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Storage Backend (Pluggable!)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STORAGE_BACKEND=redis          # Options: json, redis
                               # Coming: postgresql, mongodb, s3
                               # Default: json

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OMNIDAEMON_API_ENABLED=true    # Enable HTTP API (default: false)
OMNIDAEMON_API_PORT=8765       # API port (default: 8765)
OMNIDAEMON_API_HOST=0.0.0.0    # API host (default: 127.0.0.1)

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Logging
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # Logging level (default: INFO)
```

> 💡 **Why Pluggable?** OmniDaemon's architecture allows you to swap backends via environment variables. Currently production-ready: **Redis Streams** (event bus) and **Redis/JSON** (storage). More backends coming soon!

### Example `.env` File

   ```bash
# .env
STORAGE_BACKEND=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=omni
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=redis_stream
OMNIDAEMON_API_ENABLED=true
OMNIDAEMON_API_PORT=8765
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Environment-Specific Configs

**Development** (Local, fast iteration):
   ```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=json
JSON_STORAGE_DIR=.dev_data
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=redis_stream
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
OMNIDAEMON_API_ENABLED=true
OMNIDAEMON_API_PORT=8765
```

**Production** (Redis for everything):
```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=redis               # Distributed, persistent
REDIS_URL=redis://prod-redis.example.com:6379
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=prod_omni
EVENT_BUS_TYPE=redis_stream
OMNIDAEMON_API_ENABLED=true
OMNIDAEMON_API_PORT=8765
OMNIDAEMON_API_HOST=0.0.0.0        # Allow external connections
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING                   # Only warnings/errors in production
```

---

### Best Practices

#### 1. Resource Management

**DLQ Management**:
```bash
# Check DLQ regularly
omnidaemon bus dlq --topic your.topic

# Don't let DLQ grow unbounded - investigate recurring failures
```

**Metrics & Results**:
```bash
# Clear old metrics periodically
omnidaemon storage clear-metrics

# Results auto-expire after 24h (TTL), or clear manually
omnidaemon storage clear-results
```

#### 2. Error Handling

**Robust callback implementation**:
```python
async def my_agent(payload: dict):
    try:
        result = await process(payload)
        return {"status": "success", "data": result}
    except TemporaryError as e:
        logger.warning(f"Temporary failure: {e}")
        raise  # Will retry automatically
    except PermanentError as e:
        logger.error(f"Permanent failure: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}", exc_info=True)
        raise  # Will go to DLQ after max retries
```

#### 3. Graceful Shutdown

```python
try:
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
except (KeyboardInterrupt, asyncio.CancelledError):
    logger.info("Shutdown signal received")
finally:
    await sdk.shutdown()  # Cleans up resources
```

#### 4. Multi-Runner Coordination

**Load Balancing** (same consumer group):
```python
# Both runners process same topic, messages distributed
# Runner 1 & 2 use same agent name → load sharing
await sdk.register_agent(
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
        topic="tasks.process",
        name="worker-agent",  # Same name!
    )
)
```

**Parallel Processing** (different consumer groups):
```python
# Both runners process ALL messages independently
# Use different agent names
```

Monitor with: `omnidaemon bus groups --stream tasks.process`

#### 5. Performance Tips

- **High-Throughput**: Increase `consumer_count` in `SubscriptionConfig`
- **Low-Latency**: Deploy runners close to Redis (same region/AZ)
- **Reliability**: Monitor DLQ, set appropriate `max_retries`

## 🚀 Advanced Topics

### Multi-Runner Setup

OmniDaemon supports **horizontal scaling** via multiple runner instances. Each runner is an independent consumer in the event bus consumer group.

**Why?**
- **Load distribution** - Event bus distributes messages across all active consumers
- **High availability** - If one runner crashes, others continue processing
- **Zero downtime** - Start/stop runners without message loss

**Setup**:

Terminal 1:
```bash
python examples/omnicoreagent/agent_runner.py
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
python examples/google_adk/agent_runner.py
```

**Both runners**:
- Subscribe to the same topics
- Join the same consumer groups
- Share message processing load
- Maintain independent state

**Key Points**:
- Event bus handles load balancing automatically (Redis Streams, Kafka, etc.)
- Messages are delivered to **exactly one consumer** in a group
- Consumer groups persist even when all consumers stop (message durability)
- Use `omnidaemon health` to check active consumers

> 💡 **Note:** Load balancing behavior is provided by the event bus backend (currently Redis Streams). Other event buses (Kafka, RabbitMQ) will have similar capabilities.

---

### Agent Lifecycle Management

OmniDaemon provides two-tier agent lifecycle control:

#### 1. Pause Agent (Unsubscribe)

**Use Case**: Temporary maintenance, debugging, or traffic control

**What Happens**:
- ✅ Stops processing new messages
- ✅ Keeps consumer group (messages queue)
- ✅ Keeps DLQ (failed messages preserved)
- ✅ Keeps agent data in storage
- ✅ Can resume by restarting runner

**CLI**:
```bash
omnidaemon agent unsubscribe --topic my.topic --name MyAgent
```

**API**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/agents/my.topic/MyAgent/unsubscribe
```

**To Resume**: Just restart your agent runner!

---

#### 2. Delete Agent (Permanent Removal)

**Use Case**: Agent no longer needed, complete cleanup

**What Happens**:
- ✅ Stops processing
- ✅ Deletes consumer group (optional, default: yes)
- ✅ Deletes DLQ (optional, default: no)
- ✅ Removes agent data from storage
- ❌ Cannot resume

**CLI**:
```bash
# Default: cleanup consumer group
omnidaemon agent delete --topic my.topic --name MyAgent

# Full cleanup (consumer group + DLQ)
omnidaemon agent delete --topic my.topic --name MyAgent --delete-dlq

# Keep consumer group
omnidaemon agent delete --topic my.topic --name MyAgent --no-cleanup

# Skip confirmation
omnidaemon agent delete --topic my.topic --name MyAgent -y
```

**API**:
```bash
# Full cleanup
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8765/agents/my.topic/MyAgent?delete_group=true&delete_dlq=true"

# Keep consumer group
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8765/agents/my.topic/MyAgent?delete_group=false"

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

When agents fail to process messages after multiple retries, OmniDaemon moves them to a **Dead Letter Queue** for manual inspection.

**Configuration**:
```python
config=SubscriptionConfig(
    reclaim_idle_ms=60000,      # 60 seconds before reclaiming
    dlq_retry_limit=3,          # 3 attempts before DLQ
    consumer_count=2            # 2 concurrent consumers
)
```

**Inspect DLQ**:
```bash
# CLI
omnidaemon bus dlq --topic file_system.tasks --limit 10

# API
curl "http://localhost:8765/bus/dlq/file_system.tasks?limit=10"
```

**Handling Failed Messages**:
1. **Inspect** - Check why the message failed
2. **Fix** - Update agent logic or payload format
3. **Replay** - Republish message manually (coming soon: automatic replay)
4. **Delete** - If message is invalid

---

### Metrics & Observability

OmniDaemon tracks comprehensive metrics per agent and topic:

**Metrics Tracked**:
- `tasks_received` - Total tasks received by agent
- `tasks_processed` - Successfully completed tasks
- `tasks_failed` - Tasks that raised exceptions
- `avg_processing_time_sec` - Average processing time

**View Metrics**:
```bash
# CLI
omnidaemon metrics

# CLI with filters
omnidaemon metrics --topic file_system.tasks --limit 50

# API
curl "http://localhost:8765/metrics?topic=file_system.tasks"
```

**Sample Output**:
```
┌────────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────┬───────────┬────────┬──────────┐
│ Agent              │ Topic            │ Received │ Processed │ Failed │ Avg Time │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────┼───────────┼────────┼──────────┤
│ FILESYSTEM_AGENT   │ file_system.tasks│   1,234  │   1,200   │   34   │   2.3s   │
│ ANOTHER_AGENT      │ other.tasks      │     567  │     560   │    7   │   1.1s   │
└────────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────┴───────────┴────────┴──────────┘
```

**Metrics Persistence**:
- Stored in configured storage backend (JSON or Redis)
- Survives runner restarts
- Can be exported for external monitoring (Prometheus support coming soon)

### Bus Monitoring

Monitor event bus infrastructure directly:

> 💡 **Note:** These commands currently work with **Redis Streams**. Support for other event buses will be added as they're implemented.

#### List All Streams
```bash
omnidaemon bus list
```

Shows all active streams and their message counts.

#### Inspect Stream Messages
```bash
omnidaemon bus inspect --stream file_system.tasks --limit 10
```

Shows recent messages in a stream (useful for debugging).

#### View Consumer Groups
```bash
omnidaemon bus groups --stream file_system.tasks
```

Shows all consumer groups, pending messages, and last delivered ID.

#### DLQ Inspection
```bash
omnidaemon bus dlq --topic file_system.tasks --limit 10
```

Inspect failed messages in the dead-letter queue.

#### Comprehensive Stats
```bash
omnidaemon bus stats

# JSON output for automation
omnidaemon bus stats --json
```

Shows:
- Stream lengths
- Consumer group details
- DLQ counts
- Event bus memory usage (for Redis Streams backend)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ⚡ Quick Fixes (Start Here!)

**Problem: Nothing works?**
```bash
# 1. Is event bus backend running? (for Redis Streams)
redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG

# 2. Is OmniDaemon installed?
python -c "import omnidaemon; print('✅ Installed')"

# 3. Check health
omnidaemon health
```

**Problem: Agent not processing messages?**
```bash
# Check registration
omnidaemon agent list

# Check metrics
omnidaemon metrics --topic your.topic

# Check DLQ
omnidaemon bus dlq --topic your.topic
```

**Problem: Can't see results?**
```bash
# Results expire after 24h
# Check task status
omnidaemon task result --task-id YOUR_TASK_ID

# List recent results
omnidaemon task list
```

---

### Common Issues (Detailed)

#### 1. "Connection refused" Error

**Problem**: Can't connect to event bus backend

**Solution** (for Redis Streams backend):
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping

# If not, start Redis
redis-server

# Or via Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
```

**For other event bus backends**: Check that the backend service (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) is running and accessible at the configured URL.

#### 2. Health Check Shows "stopped" but Agent is Running

**Problem**: Stale data from previous run

**Solution**: Start time is cleared when runner stops properly. If not:
```bash
# Check health
omnidaemon health

# If shows stale state, restart your runner
# The start time will update when agents register
```

#### 3. Messages Not Being Processed

**Problem**: Agent subscribed but not consuming

**Checklist**:
```bash
# 1. Check agent is registered
omnidaemon agent list

# 2. Check consumer groups exist
omnidaemon bus groups --stream your.topic

# 3. Check if messages are in stream
omnidaemon bus inspect --stream your.topic

# 4. Check metrics for errors
omnidaemon metrics --topic your.topic

# 5. Check DLQ for failed messages
omnidaemon bus dlq --topic your.topic
```

#### 4. High Memory Usage

**Problem**: Too many messages in streams/DLQ

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check bus stats
omnidaemon bus stats

# Clear old results
omnidaemon storage clear-results

# Clear metrics (if too many)
omnidaemon storage clear-metrics

# For event bus (Redis Streams), configure maxlen:
# Messages are auto-trimmed when stream exceeds maxlen (default: 10,000)
# Other event buses have similar retention policies
```

#### 5. Agent Fails Silently

**Problem**: No error messages, agent just doesn't work

**Debug Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# 2. Check metrics for failures
omnidaemon metrics --topic your.topic

# 3. Inspect DLQ
omnidaemon bus dlq --topic your.topic

# 4. Check agent registration
omnidaemon agent get --topic your.topic --name YourAgent
```

#### 6. "Agent not found" in Health Check

**Problem**: Health check doesn't see agents

**Explanation**: CLI creates a new SDK instance. Health check queries storage directly.

**Verify**:
```bash
# Check agents in storage
omnidaemon agent list

# If empty, your runner hasn't registered yet
# Start your runner and check again
```

# Licence

```pymscada``` is distributed under the GPLv3 [license](./LICENSE).

# Running

While many parts of ```pymscada``` will run in windows, this is not intentional.

Running a useful subset requires quite a lot of steps, you have to choose the services
you want and providing meaningful configuation. ```pymscada checkout``` will create
templates of all of these for you that allows
[Debian Quickstart](./docs/debian_quickstart.md) to get you to a working web page,
however to connect to a PLC, trend data, read data and write setpoints, requires
knowledge of typical SCADA and PLC functionality.

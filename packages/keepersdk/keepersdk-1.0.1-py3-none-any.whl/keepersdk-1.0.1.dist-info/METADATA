# Keeper SDK for Python

## Overview

The Keeper SDK for Python provides developers with a comprehensive toolkit for integrating Keeper Security's password management and secrets management capabilities into Python applications. This repository contains two primary packages:

- **Keeper SDK (`keepersdk`)**: A Python library for programmatic access to Keeper Vault, enabling developers to build custom integrations, automate password management workflows, and manage enterprise console operations.
- **Keeper CLI (`keepercli`)**: A modern command-line interface for interacting with Keeper Vault and Enterprise Console, offering efficient commands for vault management, enterprise administration, and automation tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Keeper SDK or CLI, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python Version**: Python 3.10 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Keeper SDK

### About Keeper SDK

The Keeper SDK is a Python library that provides programmatic access to Keeper Security's platform. It enables developers to:

- Authenticate users and manage sessions
- Access and manipulate vault records (passwords, files, custom fields)
- Manage folders and shared folders
- Administer enterprise console operations (users, teams, roles, nodes)
- Integrate Keeper's zero-knowledge security architecture into applications
- Automate password rotation and secrets management workflows

### SDK Installation

#### From PyPI (Recommended)

Install the latest stable release from the Python Package Index:

```bash
pip install keepersdk
```

#### From Source

To install from source for development or testing purposes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Keeper-Security/keeper-sdk-python
cd keeper-sdk-python/keepersdk-package

# Install the SDK
pip install -e .
```

### SDK Environment Setup

For optimal development practices, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

**Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
```

**Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment**

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 3: Install Keeper SDK dependencies**

```bash
pip install -e keepersdk-package
```

**Step 4: Install keepersdk into the venv**
```bash
pip install -e keepercli-package
```

Your environment is now ready for SDK development.

### SDK Configuration

The Keeper SDK uses a configuration storage system to manage authentication settings and endpoints. You can use:

- **JsonConfigurationStorage**: Stores configuration in JSON format (default)
- **InMemoryConfigurationStorage**: Temporary in-memory storage for testing
- **Custom implementations**: Implement your own configuration storage

#### **Requirement for client**

If you are accessing keepersdk from a new device, you need to ensure that there is a config.json file present from which the sdk reads credentials. This ensures that the client doesn't contain any hardcoded credentials. Create the .json file in .keeper folder of current user, you might need to create a .keeper folder. A sample showing the structure of the config.json needed is shown below:

```
{
  "users": [
    {
      "user": "username@yourcompany.com",
      "password":"yourpassword",
      "server": "keepersecurity.com",
      "last_device": {
        "device_token": ""
      }
    }
  ],
  "servers": [
    {
      "server": "keepersecurity.com",
      "server_key_id": 10
    }
  ],
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_token": "",
      "private_key": "",
      "server_info": [
        {
          "server": "keepersecurity.com",
          "clone_code": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "last_login": "username@yourcompany.com",
  "last_server": "keepersecurity.com"
}
```

### SDK Usage Example

Below is a complete example demonstrating authentication, vault synchronization, and record retrieval:

```python
import sqlite3
import getpass

from keepersdk.authentication import login_auth, configuration, endpoint
from keepersdk.vault import sqlite_storage, vault_online, vault_record

# Initialize configuration and authentication context
config = configuration.JsonConfigurationStorage()
keeper_endpoint = endpoint.KeeperEndpoint(config)
login_auth_context = login_auth.LoginAuth(keeper_endpoint)

# Authenticate user
login_auth_context.login(config.get().users()[0].username, config.get().users()[0].password)

while not login_auth_context.login_step.is_final():
    if isinstance(login_auth_context.login_step, login_auth.LoginStepDeviceApproval):
        login_auth_context.login_step.send_push(login_auth.DeviceApprovalChannel.KeeperPush)
        print("Device approval request sent. Login to existing vault/console or ask admin to approve this device and then press return/enter to resume")
        input()
    elif isinstance(login_auth_context.login_step, login_auth.LoginStepPassword):
        password = getpass.getpass('Enter password: ')
        login_auth_context.login_step.verify_password(password)
    elif isinstance(login_auth_context.login_step, login_auth.LoginStepTwoFactor):
        channel = login_auth_context.login_step.get_channels()[0]
        code = getpass.getpass(f'Enter 2FA code for {channel.channel_name}: ')
        login_auth_context.login_step.send_code(channel.channel_uid, code)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError()

# Check if login was successful
if isinstance(login_auth_context.login_step, login_auth.LoginStepConnected):
    # Obtain authenticated session
    keeper_auth = login_auth_context.login_step.take_keeper_auth()
    
    # Set up vault storage (using SQLite in-memory database)
    conn = sqlite3.Connection('file::memory:', uri=True)
    vault_storage = sqlite_storage.SqliteVaultStorage(
        lambda: conn,
        vault_owner=bytes(keeper_auth.auth_context.username, 'utf-8')
    )
    
    # Initialize vault and synchronize with Keeper servers
    vault = vault_online.VaultOnline(keeper_auth, vault_storage)
    vault.sync_down()
    
    # Access and display vault records
    print("Vault Records:")
    print("-" * 50)
    for record in vault.vault_data.records():
        print(f'Title: {record.title}')
        
        # Handle legacy (v2) records
        if record.version == 2:
            legacy_record = vault.vault_data.load_record(record.record_uid)
            if isinstance(legacy_record, vault_record.PasswordRecord):
                print(f'Username: {legacy_record.login}')
                print(f'URL: {legacy_record.link}')
        
        # Handle modern (v3+) records
        elif record.version >= 3:
            print(f'Record Type: {record.record_type}')
        
        print("-" * 50)
    vault.close()
    keeper_auth.close()
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never hardcode credentials in production code
- Always implement proper two-factor authentication
- Use device approval flows for enhanced security
- Consider using environment variables or secure vaults for credential management

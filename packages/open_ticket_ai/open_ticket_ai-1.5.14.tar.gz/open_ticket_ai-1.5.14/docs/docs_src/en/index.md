## Build Plugins and Grow with Open Ticket AI

Open Ticket AI ships with a fully documented plugin SDK so you can extend the platform with new
integrations, automations, and AI models. Package your plugin as a standard Python project, publish
it to a public or private index, and start monetizing your expertise without waiting for an
official marketplace.

- Follow the step-by-step [Plugin Development Guide](/en/developers/plugin_development) to scaffold
  a new integration in minutes.
- Distribute plugins however you like—from private PyPI servers to commercial offerings with license
  checks—and list them on the [Plugins Overview](/en/users/plugins) to reach the community.
- Leverage our adapter architecture to connect to any helpdesk or data source while keeping the core
  platform untouched.

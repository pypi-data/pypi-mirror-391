        Fit the calculator to a chemical environment for equilibrium calculations.
        
        This method prepares the calculator by storing the environment and generating
        concentration equations based on the stoichiometry of all reactions. The
        concentration equations represent how each compound's concentration changes
        as a function of reaction extents.
        
        The fit method must be called before calling calculate(). After fitting,
        the calculator is ready to solve for equilibrium concentrations.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        env : Enviroment
            The chemical environment containing:
            - compounds: List of chemical compounds in the system
            - reactions: List of chemical reactions with equilibrium constants
            - concentrations: Initial concentrations of all compounds
            - stoichiometric_coefficient_array: Matrix of stoichiometric coefficients
            - T: Temperature of the system

        Notes
        -----
        - This method sets self.fitted to True, enabling the calculate() method
        - Concentration equations are generated as symbolic strings representing
          how concentrations depend on reaction extents (x1, x2, ...)
        - The environment is stored as self.env for use in subsequent calculations
        - Calling fit() again will overwrite the previous environment and equations

        """
        Calculate equilibrium concentrations for the fitted chemical system.
        
        This method solves for the equilibrium state by finding reaction extents
        that satisfy the mass-action law (Q = K) for all reactions. It uses
        numerical optimization to minimize the residual between the reaction
        quotient (Q) and equilibrium constants (K).
        
        The method supports three different optimization algorithms:
        - "bgd" (batch gradient descent): Processes all reactions simultaneously
        - "sgd" (stochastic gradient descent): Processes reactions in random order
        - "newton" (Newton's method): Uses second-order information for faster convergence
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        max_iter : int, optional
            Maximum number of iterations for the optimization algorithm.
            Default is 5000.
        learning_rate : float, optional
            Step size for gradient-based updates. Higher values may converge
            faster but risk instability. Default is 0.1.
        tol : float, optional
            Convergence tolerance. The algorithm stops when the residual
            norm falls below this value. Default is 1e-8.
        backtrack_beta : float, optional
            Backtracking line search parameter. Controls how aggressively
            the step size is reduced when constraints are violated.
            Default is 0.5.
        min_concentration : float, optional
            Minimum concentration threshold to prevent numerical issues
            with logarithms. Concentrations below this are clamped.
            Default is 1e-12.
        
        Returns
        -------
        list[float]
            List of equilibrium concentrations (in the same order as
            self.env.compounds). Concentrations are guaranteed to be
            non-negative.
        
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the environment has not been fitted using the fit() method.
        
        Notes
        -----
        - Solid and liquid phases are excluded from equilibrium expressions
          (only gas and aqueous phases participate in mass-action law)
        - The method uses backtracking line search to ensure non-negative
          concentrations and objective function improvement
        - Convergence is checked based on both residual norms and gradient norms
        - The solution extents are stored in self.x_solution after calculation

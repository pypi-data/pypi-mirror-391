# JEE Mains PYQS Database

This project provides a structured database of more than 14,000 previous year questions (PYQS) from JEE Mains. The questions are reverse engineered from API endpoints of a subscription site and cached for efficient use. It supports clustering, filtering, and rendering of questions into HTML for easy study.

## Features

* Access to 14k+ JEE Mains PYQS  
* Precomputed embeddings using the `intfloat/e5-base-v2` model for efficient clustering  
* Cluster similar questions together based on semantic embeddings  
* Apply chainable filters (by chapter, topic, year, etc.)  
* Render filtered or clustered questions into HTML using themed styles  

## Project Structure

The core folder contains the following modules:

* **cache.py** – Defines the `Cache` class for creating and loading internal caches. Not intended for direct user interaction.  
* **chapter.py** – Defines the `Chapter` class, which is stored in the `DataBaseChapters` cache file. Internal use only.  
* **data_base.py** – Defines the `DataBase` class. This must be initialized before any operations.  
* **filter.py** – Defines the `Filter` class. Provides chainable methods to filter questions and update the current set.  
* **question.py** – Defines the `Question` object.  
* **styles.py** – Contains themed HTML styles for rendering.  
* **pdfy.py** – Provides functions to convert clusters or sets of questions into HTML.  

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/HostServer001/jee_mains_pyqs_data_base
```

Navigate into the project directory and ensure dependencies are installed.

## Usage

### Basic Initialization

```python
import os
from core import DataBase, Filter, pdfy

data_base_path = "path_to_data"
cache_path = f"{data_base_path}/cache"

# Initialize database
db = DataBase(data_base_path, cache_path)

# Initialize filter
filter = Filter(db.chapters_dict)

# Inspect available chapters
print(filter.get_possible_filter_values()["chapter"])
```

### Filtering by Chapter and Year

```python
# Get all questions from a specific chapter in the last 3 years
questions = filter.by_chapter("thermodynamics").by_n_last_yrs(3).get()

for q in questions:
    print(q.statement)
```

### Clustering and Rendering

```python
# Cluster questions by topic and render to HTML
filter.current_set = filter.by_chapter("organic-compounds").by_n_last_yrs(5).get()
cluster = filter.cluster()

pdfy.render_cluster_to_html_skim(
    cluster,
    "organic_compounds.html",
    "Organic Compounds - Last 5 Years"
)
```

### Example: Render Chapter Questions by Topic

```python
def render_chapter(chapter_name: str):
    all_q = filter.by_chapter(chapter_name).by_n_last_yrs(5).get()
    os.makedirs(chapter_name, exist_ok=True)

    for topic in filter.get_possible_filter_values()["topic"]:
        filter.current_set = all_q
        filter.by_topic(topic)
        cluster = filter.cluster()
        pdfy.render_cluster_to_html_skim(
            cluster,
            f"{chapter_name}/{topic}.html",
            topic
        )

render_chapter("alcohols-phenols-and-ethers")
```

## Data Caches

* **DataBaseChapters** – Contains a dictionary with chapter names as keys and `Chapter` objects as values.  
* **EmbeddingsChapters** – Contains precomputed embeddings of all questions to save computation time.  

## Contributing

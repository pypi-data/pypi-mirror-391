Update the Solar Gain task to measure vignetting signal, compute a single gain for each beam (as opposed to for each beam and modulator state),
and stop applying residual spectral shifts to the characteristic spectra before removing from the input gain array.
See the `Science Changelog <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/visp/en/stable/scientific_changelog.html>`_ and
`gain algorithm docs <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/visp/en/stable/gain_correction.html>`_ for more information.

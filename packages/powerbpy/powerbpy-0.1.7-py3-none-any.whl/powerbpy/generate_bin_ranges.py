      Note that this measure relies on raw values existing in the back-end data or PBI virtual table, not values that come from calculations 
      done within the PBI dataset via measure. It may not be possible to consider all the values given by a measure for each county as a set 
      from which percentiles can be calculated. At least I haven’t been successful at this.
      
      On a map visual, we are “selecting” a specific county when we hover the mouse over a particular area. 
      We want to make sure we are calculating the percentiles based on all available counties.
       Here, I chose REMOVEFILTERS() to make sure that the entire set of values is considered when calculating the percentiles. 
       Without this, the set being used for the calculation would just consist of the single value of the hovered-on county.
      
      For quintile calculations, calculate the 0th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th, and 100th percentiles for the data. 
      This will allow you to create five bins

      The upper bound of bin 2 has the same logic as the upper bound of bin 1 (check if the next percentile is the same as the previous),
       plus another logic check. It also checks If the lower bound of bin 2 is less than the 40th percentile.
        This check avoids the potential of the upper bound being lower than that of the lower bound of the same bin.
         If either of these criteria are met, increment the lower bound by the most granular possible value based on the value being measured.
      
      This process repeats through bin 5. 
      The lower bound of each bin is calculated in the same way, using the value of the upper bound of the previous bin.

      About the python code --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This incredibly dense and complicated process recreates a bunch of power BI measures.
      The easiest way to inspect the measures is run this script and then open the TMDL file and look at the generated DAX

      I have no idea how leaflet, shiny or ggplot2 calculates percentile bins under the hood and/or on the fly
      And that's sort of the point, it amazes me that microsoft creates a supposedly "business user friendly" "low code" product
      That requires the user writing a bunch of complicated code to implement binning, when you can do it in R right out of the box 
      with only a few lines of code.....

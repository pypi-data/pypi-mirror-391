answerFormatPrompt = """Solve this math problem step-by-step. Follow this format exactly:

1. [calculation step]
2. [calculation step]
3. [calculation step]
4. [Continue with additional steps as needed]
Answer: [number]

Requirements:
- Number each step starting from 1.
- Each step should have the number followed by a period to start a newline, some examples: "1.", "2.", "3."
- Put each step on a separate line
- Make each step a single sentence describing one operation
- End with "Answer: " followed only by the final number
- Use no other formatting, symbols, or text outside this structure
- **Do not use markdown formatting at all** """

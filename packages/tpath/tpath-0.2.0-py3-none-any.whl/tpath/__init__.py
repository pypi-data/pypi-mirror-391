"""
TPath - A pathlib extension with time-based age and size utilities.

This package provides enhanced pathlib functionality with lambda-based
age and size operations. Users can import directly from tpath without
needing to know the internal package structure.

Examples:
    >>> from tpath import TPath, Size
    >>> path = TPath("myfile.txt")
    >>> path.age.days
    >>> path.size.gb
    >>> Size.parse("1.5GB")

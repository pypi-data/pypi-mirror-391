Morelia is a free, open-source Python application programming interface (API) for Pinnacle Technology, Inc. data acquisition POD devices. Morelia core modules, usage examples, and supporting documentation can be found here on GitHub and are available freely under the New BSD License. 

Currently, the API supports 8206-HR, 8401-HR, 8229, 8480-SC, and 8274-D POD devices. In the future, we will offer support to other Pinnacle devices. 

You can find extensive documentation for the package [here](https://pinnacle-technology-inc.github.io/Morelia).

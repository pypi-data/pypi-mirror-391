  <p>
    Manual invoice retrieval slows finance teams down, especially when every portal has its own login choreography and UI quirks. The
    <strong>RealTimeX Invoice Fetcher</strong> automates those repetitive steps with deterministic precision. It reads the bundled playbooks for
    portals like FPT and EVN, opens the browser, scales coordinates to any resolution, and drives the interface exactly as documented.
  </p>

  <p>
    Credentials remain secure end to end. The agent never sees raw secrets; instead it pulls the correct credential reference, types each field
    through the secure toolchain, and confirms success with lightweight evidence.

    A lock backed by shared memory that can be accessed by name from any process.

    This solves the pickling problem with multiprocessing.Lock - instead of trying
    to pickle the lock object, we just store the lock name and each process connects
    to the same shared memory lock by name.

    Uses a simple atomic flag (0 = unlocked, 1 = locked) with spin-lock semantics.

    Usage:
        # Process A creates the lock
        lock = SharedMemoryLock(name="my_lock", create=True, run_id="app1")

        # Process B connects to the same lock
        lock = SharedMemoryLock(name="my_lock", create=False, run_id="app1")

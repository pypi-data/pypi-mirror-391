"""
Shared memory mutex implementation for blocking waits.

This mutex is designed for long waits (seconds to minutes) where processes
need to block without busy-waiting. Uses atomic operations with longer sleep
intervals compared to SharedMemoryLock.

Key features:
- Atomic operations for mutual exclusion
- Longer sleep intervals (10ms) for blocking waits
- Cross-platform (works on Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Suitable for queue operations and long critical sections

    A blocking mutex backed by shared memory using atomic operations.

    - Queue operations where processes wait for items
    - Long critical sections (seconds to minutes)
    - Scenarios where processes may wait without wasting CPU

        # Process A creates the mutex

        # Process B connects to the same mutex

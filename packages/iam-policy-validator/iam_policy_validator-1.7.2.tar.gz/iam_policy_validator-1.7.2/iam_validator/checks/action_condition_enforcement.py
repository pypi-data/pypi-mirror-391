"""
Action-Specific Condition Enforcement Check (Unified)

This built-in check ensures that specific actions have required conditions.
Supports ALL types of conditions: MFA, IP, VPC, time, tags, encryption, etc.

Supports advanced "all_of" and "any_of" logic for both actions and conditions.
Supports both STATEMENT-LEVEL and POLICY-LEVEL enforcement.

Common use cases:
- iam:PassRole must have iam:PassedToService condition
- Sensitive actions must have MFA conditions
- Actions must have source IP restrictions
- Resources must have required tags
- Combine multiple conditions (MFA + IP + Tags)
- Policy-level: Ensure ALL statements granting certain actions have MFA

Configuration in iam-validator.yaml:

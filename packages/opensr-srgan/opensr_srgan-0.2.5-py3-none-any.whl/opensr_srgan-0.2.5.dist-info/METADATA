           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# 🌍 Single Image Super-Resolution Remote Sensing 'SRGAN'

**Remote-Sensing-SRGAN** is a research-grade GAN framework for **super-resolution of Sentinel-2 and other remote-sensing imagery**. It supports arbitrary band counts, configurable generator/discriminator designs, scalable depth/width, and a modular loss system designed for stable GAN training on EO data.

---

## 📖 Documentation

Full docs live at **[srgan.opensr.eu](https://srgan.opensr.eu/)**. They cover usage, configuration, training recipes, and deployment tips in depth.

## 🧠 Highlights

* **Flexible models:** swap between SRResNet, RCAB, RRDB, LKA, ESRGAN, and stochastic generators with YAML-only changes.
* **Remote-sensing aware losses:** combine spectral, perceptual, and adversarial objectives with tunable weights.
* **Stable training loop:** generator pretraining, adversarial ramp-ups, EMA, and multi-GPU Lightning support out of the box.
* **PyPI distribution:** `pip install opensr-srgan` for ready-to-use presets or custom configs.
* **Extensive Logging:** Logging all important information automatically to `WandB` for optimal insights.

---

## 🏗️ Configuration Examples

All key knobs are exposed via YAML in the `opensr_srgan/configs` folder:

* **Model**: `in_channels`, `n_channels`, `n_blocks`, `scale`, ESRGAN knobs (`growth_channels`, `res_scale`, `out_channels`), `block_type ∈ {SRResNet, res, rcab, rrdb, lka}`
* **Losses**: `l1_weight`, `sam_weight`, `perceptual_weight`, `tv_weight`, `adv_loss_beta`
* **Training**: `pretrain_g_only`, `g_pretrain_steps`, `adv_loss_ramp_steps`, `label_smoothing`, generator LR warmup (`Schedulers.g_warmup_steps`, `Schedulers.g_warmup_type`), discriminator cadence controls
* **Data**: band order, normalization stats, crop sizes, augmentations

---

## 🎚️ Training Stabilization Strategies

* **G‑only pretraining:** Train with content/perceptual losses while the adversarial term is held at zero during the first `g_pretrain_steps`.
* **Adversarial ramp‑up:** Increase the BCE adversarial weight **linearly** or smoothly (**cosine**) over `adv_loss_ramp_steps` until it reaches `adv_loss_beta`.
* **Generator LR warmup:** Ramp the generator optimiser with a **cosine** or **linear** schedule for the first 1–5k steps via `Schedulers.g_warmup_steps`/`g_warmup_type` before switching to plateau-based reductions.
* **EMA smoothing:** Enable `Training.EMA.enabled` to keep a shadow copy of the generator. Decay values in the 0.995–0.9999 range balance responsiveness with stability and are swapped in automatically for validation/inference.

The schedule and ramp make training **easier, safer, and more reproducible**.

---

## ⚙️ Config‑driven components

| Component | Options | Config keys |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Generators** | `SRResNet`, `res`, `rcab`, `rrdb`, `lka`, `esrgan`, `stochastic_gan` | `Generator.model_type`, depth via `Generator.n_blocks`, width via `Generator.n_channels`, kernels/scale plus ESRGAN-specific `growth_channels`, `res_scale`, `out_channels`. |
| **Discriminators** | `standard` SRGAN CNN, `patchgan`, `esrgan` | `Discriminator.model_type`, granularity with `Discriminator.n_blocks`, ESRGAN-specific `base_channels`, `linear_size`. |
| **Content losses** | L1, Spectral Angle Mapper, VGG19/LPIPS perceptual metrics, Total Variation | Weighted by `Training.Losses.*` (e.g. `l1_weight`, `sam_weight`, `perceptual_weight`, `perceptual_metric`, `tv_weight`). |
| **Adversarial loss** | BCE‑with‑logits on real/fake logits | Warmup via `Training.pretrain_g_only`, ramped by `adv_loss_ramp_steps`, capped at `adv_loss_beta`, optional label smoothing. |

The YAML keeps the SRGAN flexible: swap architectures or rebalance perceptual vs. spectral fidelity without touching the code.

## 🧑‍🚀 Authors, Acknowledgements, and Notes on AI Usage

Developed by **Simon Donike** (IPL–UV) within the **ESA Φ-lab / OpenSR** initiative.  
> The development history of this code began in 2020 with the implementation of an SR-GAN for a MSc thesis project. Since then, over several iterations, the codebase has been expanded and many training tweaks implemented, based on the experiences made training SR-GANs for the OpenSR project. The fundamental training outline, training tweaks, normalizations, and inference procedures are built upon that experience.  
The added complexity that came with (a) the implementation of many different models and blocks, (b) more data sources, (c) according normalizations, and (d) complex testing and documentation structures, was handled to varying degrees with the help of *Codex*. Specifically, the docs, the automated testing workflows the dataset handling, and the flexible normalizer are largely AI generated. These sections have been checked manually to the best of my ability, but please be aware of this when diving into the code.

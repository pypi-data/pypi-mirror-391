**Phonemize** is a multilingual **grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P)** conversion library built with Transformer models. It’s designed for **high accuracy**, **fast inference**, and **simple integration** into text-to-speech (TTS) or other speech-related systems.

## Key Features

-   **Easy-to-use API**: A simple interface for both training and inference.
-   **Multilingual Support**: Train a single model on multiple languages.
-   **High Performance**: Fast and accurate predictions powered by Transformer models.
-   **Custom Training**: Effortlessly train your own models in just a few lines of code.
-   **Optimized for TTS**: Ideal for both real-time and offline text-to-speech pipelines.

## Installation

To install Phonemize, use the following command:

```bash
pip install phonemize
```
To train your own models, install the full package with all training dependencies:

```bash

```

## Quickstart

Load a pre-trained model and perform phoneme prediction with this simple example:

```python
from phonemize import Phonemizer

# Load the pre-trained model from a checkpoint
phonemizer = Phonemizer.from_checkpoint("phonemize_m1.pt")

# Phonemize an English text
result = phonemizer("Phonemizing an English text is imposimpable!", lang="en_us")

# Print the result
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
foʊnɪmaɪzɪŋ æn ɪŋglɪʃ tɛkst ɪz ɪmpəzɪmpəbəl!
```

## Training Your Own Model

You can easily train your own forward or autoregressive Transformer model. All configuration parameters are defined in a simple YAML file (e.g., `configs/forward.yaml`).

```python
from phonemize.preprocess import preprocess
from phonemize.train import train

# Define your training data
train_data = [
    ("en_us", "young", "jʌŋ"),
    ("de", "benützten", "bənʏt͡stn̩")
] * 1000

# Define your validation data
val_data = [
    ("en_us", "young", "jʌŋ"),
    ("de", "benützten", "bənʏt͡stn̩")
] * 100

# Specify the configuration file
config_file = "configs/forward.yaml"

# Preprocess the data
preprocess(
    config_file=config_file,
    train_data=train_data,
    val_data=val_data,
    deduplicate_train_data=False
)

# Train the model
train(rank=0, num_gpus=1, config_file=config_file)
```

Checkpoints will be saved in the directory specified in your configuration file.

## Inference Example

To perform inference with your trained model:

```python
from phonemize import Phonemizer

# Load your custom model from a checkpoint
phonemizer = Phonemizer.from_checkpoint("checkpoints/best_model.pt")

# Get the phonemes for a given text
phonemes = phonemizer("Phonemizing text is simple!", lang="en_us")
print(phonemes)
```

To inspect detailed predictions, including confidence scores:

```python
result = phonemizer.phonemise_list(["Phonemizing text is simple!"], lang="en_us")

for word, pred in result.predictions.items():
    print(f"Word: {word}, Phonemes: {pred.phonemes}, Confidence: {pred.confidence}")
```

## TorchScript Export

For optimized performance, you can easily export your trained Transformer model to TorchScript:

```python
import torch
from phonemize import Phonemizer

# Load the model from a checkpoint
phonemizer = Phonemizer.from_checkpoint("checkpoints/best_model.pt")

# Convert the model to a TorchScript module
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(phonemizer.predictor.model)
phonemizer.predictor.model = scripted_model

# Run inference with the TorchScript model
phonemizer("Running the TorchScript model!")
```

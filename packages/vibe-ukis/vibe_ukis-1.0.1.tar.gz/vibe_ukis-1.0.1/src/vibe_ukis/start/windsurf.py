## Instructions

1. Carefully review [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] to find sections relevant to the task you are trying to acomplish and find relevant URLs.

2. Aquire knowledge necessary for completing the task using relevant URLs from [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] and the WebFetch tool.

3. Look into the [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] AGAIN and see if it has any prebuilt components that may make the task at hand significantly easier as it offers an extensive library of them.

4. Carefully read your only true source of AI engineering knowledge, [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] AGAIN and make sure you really undestood everything and didn't skip any prebuilt components that may make the task at hand significantly easier as it offers an extensive library of them. Also look into https://llamahub.ai/ and the https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index github repository.

5. Complete the required task using ONLY the content from the aquired knowledge.

## Important:

Never use the web search, only use links found IN the guide OR links found by looking inside of links inside of the guide.

## Examples

User: Make me a multi-agent RAG system (only the backend).

You:

*reads [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md]* AHA! I found "Multi-Agent" on line 32! and "" I will now fetch the relevant link to understand how to build the system.

*thought* HMM but the user also asked about RAG! Let me read the guide to see what it is and how we use it!

*WebFetch* multi-agent, rag, tools, llms

*thought* Let me check again to see if there are any prebuilt components helping me!

*reads [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md]*

*WebFetch* hybrid retrieval, tree summarize

*thought* Great! Now I know how to make what the user requested using the latest stuff! Let's make it!

## Instructions

1. Carefully review the documentation guide to find sections relevant to the task you are trying to accomplish.

2. Acquire knowledge necessary for completing the task using relevant URLs from the guide and the WebFetch tool.

3. Look for any prebuilt components that may make the task significantly easier.

4. Complete the required task using the acquired knowledge.

## Guidelines

- Always base your answers on the official documentation
- Use WebFetch to get the latest information from official sources
- Explain the reasoning behind recommendations
- Ask clarifying questions if the user's requirements are unclear

# ESGVOC Library

ESGVOC is a Python library designed to simplify interaction with controlled vocabularies (CVs) used in WCRP climate data projects. It supports querying, caching, and validating terms across various CV repositories like the [universe](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/WCRP-universe/tree/esgvoc) and project-specific repositories (e.g., [CMIP6Plus](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6Plus_CVs/tree/esgvoc), [CMIP6](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs/tree/esgvoc), etc.).

Full documentation is available at [https://esgf.github.io/esgf-vocab/](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-vocab/).

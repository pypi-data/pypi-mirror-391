    A 'source' refers to a numerical representations of the Earth's climate system. They simulate \
    the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. These models are based \
    on fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes and are used to understand past, \
    present, and future climate conditions. Each source or model is typically associated with a \
    specific research institution, center, or group. For instance, models like 'EC-Earth' are \
    developed by a consortium of European institutes, while 'GFDL-CM4' is developed by the \
    Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in the United States.

    Attack Patterns are used to help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow,

    "spear phishing": a common type of attack where an attacker sends a carefully crafted e-mail message
    to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or open an attachment to deliver malware.

    Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a particular threat actor
    (e.g., they might generally say that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.

    Campaigns are often attributed to an intrusion set and threat actors. The threat actors may reuse known
    infrastructure from the intrusion set or may set up new infrastructure specific for conducting that campaign.

    Campaigns can be characterized by their objectives and the incidents they cause, people or resources they target,
    and the resources (infrastructure, intelligence, Malware, Tools, etc.) they use.

    For example, a Campaign could be used to describe a crime syndicate's attack using a specific variant of
    malware and new C2 servers against the executives of ACME Bank during the summer of 2016 in order
    to gain secret information about an upcoming merger with another bank.

# 4.14 Observed Data
class ObservedData(StixDomain):

    Observed Data conveys information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using
    the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). For example, Observed Data can capture information about an IP address,
    a network connection, a file, or a registry key. Observed Data is not an intelligence assertion, it is simply the
    raw information without any context for what it means.

    Observed Data can capture that a piece of information was seen one or more times. Meaning, it can capture both a
    single observation of a single entity (file, network connection) as well as the aggregation of multiple
    observations of an entity. When the number_observed property is 1 the Observed Data represents a single entity.
    When the number_observed property is greater than 1, the Observed Data represents several instances of an entity
    potentially collected over a period of time. If a time window is known, that can be captured using the
    first_observed and last_observed properties. When used to collect aggregate data, it is likely that some properties
    in the SCO (e.g., timestamp properties) will be omitted because they would differ for each of the individual
    observations.

    Observed Data may be used by itself (without relationships) to convey raw data collected from any source including
    analyst reports, sandboxes, and network and host-based detection tools. An intelligence producer conveying
    Observed Data SHOULD include as much context (e.g. SCOs) as possible that supports the use of the observed data set
    in systems expecting to utilize the Observed Data for improved security. This includes all SCOs that matched on an
    Indicator pattern and are represented in the collected observed event (or events) being conveyed in the
    Observed Data object. For example, a firewall could emit a single Observed Data instance containing a single
    Network Traffic object for each connection it sees. The firewall could also aggregate data and instead send out an
    Observed Data instance every ten minutes with an IP address and an appropriate number_observed value to indicate
    the number of times that IP address was observed in that window. A sandbox could emit an Observed Data instance
    containing a file hash that it discovered.

    Observed Data may also be related to other SDOs to represent raw data that is relevant to those objects.
    For example, the Sighting Relationship object, can relate an Indicator, Malware, or other SDO to a specific
    Observed Data to represent the raw information that led to the creation of the Sighting (e.g., what was actually

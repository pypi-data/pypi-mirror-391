## Permanent Global Policy Amendment: Duplication Mitigation

**Effective Immediately:**

- All session implementation, compliance, and automation workflows must enforce intelligent duplication mitigation.
- Duplicates are to be merged or deleted if and only if:
  - Data preservation is guaranteed (no unique content lost).
  - Minimalism is enforced (no unnecessary files or redundancy).
- Intelligent analysis (automated or manual) must be performed before any merger or deletion.
- Legacy or ambiguous versions are archived if needed, but redundant files are removed to maintain a clean, minimal, and secure codebase.
- This amendment is permanent and global, superseding previous non-destructive-only rules where duplication is present.

**Integration:**

- Applies to all session tiers, compliance audits, and agent-driven workflows.
- All future policy changes must cascade through this mechanism.
- The system remains whole, secure, and improved, with minimalism as a core principle.

# Legacy & Deprecated Code

Information about code that has been archived, deprecated, or moved to quarantine.

## Files

- **LEGACY_ARCHIVE_STATUS.md** - Status of all archived code
- **LEGACY_FEATURE_MAP.md** - Where old features moved to
- **QUICKSTART_LEGACY.md** - Legacy quick start guide (deprecated, see Getting Started guide)

## Understanding Legacy Code

CodeSentinel follows the **non-destructive operations principle (T0-2)**: No code is deleted without being archived first.

Deprecated code is moved to `quarantine_legacy_archive/` for historical reference and potential recovery.

### Finding Old Functionality

1. Check [LEGACY_FEATURE_MAP.md](LEGACY_FEATURE_MAP.md) - Where did this feature go?
2. Check [LEGACY_ARCHIVE_STATUS.md](LEGACY_ARCHIVE_STATUS.md) - Is it archived?
3. Check `quarantine_legacy_archive/` - Full archived code with version history

**Compliance**: T0-2 (Non-destructive operations) + T3-8 (Legacy code archiving)

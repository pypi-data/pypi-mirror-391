# SEAM Protection™ Branding Guide

## Overview

**SEAM Protection™** (Security, Efficiency, And Minimalism) is the official trademark and branding for CodeSentinel's core governance principle.

This document outlines the strategic integration of SEAM Protection branding throughout the codebase with a subtle, minimalist aesthetic.

## Principle Definition

**SEAM Protection™** represents the hierarchical governance framework:

1. **Security** - Absolute priority, non-negotiable
2. **Efficiency** - Optimize operations without compromising security
3. **Minimalism** - Retain only essential components and features

### Trademark Usage

- Use **SEAM Protected™** as the official branded form (with ™ symbol)
- Expand to "Security, Efficiency, And Minimalism" on first mention or in formal contexts
- Phrase: "SEAM Protected by CodeSentinel" for marketing materials
- Phrase: "this repository is SEAM-tight" for casual technical contexts

## Placement Strategy

### Primary Locations (Subtle, High-Impact)

1. **Package Documentation** (`codesentinel/__init__.py`)
   - Header with "SEAM Protected™ by CodeSentinel"
   - Includes expansion for clarity

2. **Security Policy** (`SECURITY.md`)
   - Core architecture section
   - Replaces verbose "SECURITY > EFFICIENCY > MINIMALISM"

3. **CLI Help Text** (`codesentinel/cli/__init__.py`)
   - Main description: "SEAM Protected™ Automated Maintenance & Security Monitoring"
   - Dev-audit output: References to SEAM Protection principle

4. **GUI Wizard** (`codesentinel/gui_wizard_v2.py`)
   - Header display: "SEAM Protected™" badge
   - Minimalist single-line replacement

5. **AI Agent Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
   - Updated intro with trademark
   - Clarifies Security > Efficiency > Minimalism hierarchy

### Secondary Locations (Documentation)

- **README.md**: "SEAM-Tight Security" in Core Features
- **dev_audit.py**: Replaced ASCII art with "SEAM Protected™" statement
- **tools/codesentinel/duplication_detector.py**: Referenced in architecture
- **All satellite docs**: Maintained consistent terminology

## Design Principles

### Minimalism

- No excessive repetition of the trademark
- Single-word tag "SEAM-tight" for technical contexts
- Avoid overuse in comments or inline code

### Consistency

- Always use "SEAM Protected™" with trademark symbol for branding
- Technical references use "SEAM Protection" or "SEAM principle"
- Informal contexts use "SEAM-tight" as appropriate

### Subtlety

- Appears in strategic locations, not everywhere
- Does not distract from code functionality
- Enhances rather than clutters documentation

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Updated `codesentinel/__init__.py` package docstring
- [x] Updated `SECURITY.md` architecture section

**Status:** RETAINED - Under verification period (through v1.0.x)

### Purpose

Contains archived code from previous CodeSentinel versions that has been:

- Replaced with improved implementations
- Deprecated due to design changes
- Consolidated to eliminate duplication

### Current Contents

The archive preserves:

- Legacy maintenance scripts
- Previous CLI implementations
- Deprecated configuration formats
- Archived test files

### Retention Policy

**Keep Until:**

1. Feature parity confirmed for all archived functionality
2. At least 2 stable releases published (v1.0.x series)
3. No user reports of missing features for 90+ days
4. All critical features validated through comprehensive testing

**Current Verification Status (v1.0.3):**

-  Core CLI functionality - Feature complete
-  Configuration management - Enhanced and stable
-  Maintenance automation - Improved in tools/
- ⏳ GUI features - Under evaluation (gui_wizard_v2.py in main codebase)
- ⏳ User feedback period - Ongoing

### Removal Plan

When ready to remove:

```bash
# Create compressed archive
tar -czf docs/legacy_v0_archive_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz quarantine_legacy_archive/

# Verify archive integrity
tar -tzf docs/legacy_v0_archive_*.tar.gz | head -20

# Document what was archived
echo "Archived legacy code to docs/legacy_v0_archive_*.tar.gz" >> CHANGELOG.md

# Remove directory
rm -rf quarantine_legacy_archive/
```

### Restoration Process

If archived code is needed:

```bash
# Extract from archive
tar -xzf docs/legacy_v0_archive_*.tar.gz

# Review specific files
cd quarantine_legacy_archive/
```

**Decision Authority:** Retain until v2.0.0 or minimum 6 months from v1.0.0 release (whichever is later)

**Next Review:** v1.1.0 release

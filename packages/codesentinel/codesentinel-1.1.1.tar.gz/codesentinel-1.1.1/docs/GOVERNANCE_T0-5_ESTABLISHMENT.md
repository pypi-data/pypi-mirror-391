# T0-5 Permanent Policy Establishment

**Date**: November 6, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETED AND COMMITTED  
**Classification**: Constitutional (Irreversible) Governance Policy

## Policy Summary

**T0-5: Framework Compliance Review Requirement** - Every package release (pre-release and production) must include comprehensive framework compliance review verifying SECURITY > EFFICIENCY > MINIMALISM alignment, persistent policies compliance, technical debt assessment, and long-term sustainability evaluation. Framework compliance review is a release-blocking requirement.

## Why T0 (Constitutional) Classification?

The T0 tier is reserved for immutable principles that define CodeSentinel's identity. T0-5 qualifies because:

1. **Non-Negotiable**: User directive was explicit: "required and permanent part" - no exceptions
2. **Irreversible**: Cannot be skipped or deferred without board approval
3. **Release Blocking**: Must be completed before any package can be deployed
4. **Quality Gate**: Prevents regression to v1.0.3.beta1 issues (where tests failed, compliance was bypassed)
5. **Governance**: Establishes immutable quality standards for all future releases

## Policy Context

### Problem Addressed

v1.0.3.beta1 deployment revealed critical gaps:

- Test failures (4/12 passing) were deployed to production
- No compliance assessment before release
- No framework alignment verification
- No technical debt evaluation

### Solution

Establish compliance review as irreversible governance requirement:

- Every release must include formal compliance assessment
- Review must verify framework principle alignment
- Review must assess technical debt impact
- Review must evaluate long-term sustainability
- Compliance clearance is release-blocking

## Implementation Details

### Documents Updated

1. **PRIORITY_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM.md**
   - Added T0-5 to Tier 0 Policies section
   - Includes full policy specification
   - Located in docs/architecture/

2. **.github/copilot-instructions.md**
   - Added T0-5 to Persistent Policies
   - Includes implementation requirements
   - Enhanced description with T0 classification note

3. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added "Governance" section to v1.0.3.beta2
   - Documents permanent policy establishment
   - Explains compliance requirements and tier classification

### Release Compliance Artifacts

The following artifacts must be created with every package release going forward:

1. **Framework Compliance Review**
   - Verifies SECURITY > EFFICIENCY > MINIMALISM alignment
   - Validates all persistent policies (T0-1 through T0-5)
   - Assesses technical debt
   - Evaluates long-term sustainability
   - Example: `FRAMEWORK_COMPLIANCE_REVIEW_1_0_3_BETA2.md`

2. **Technical Architecture Review**
   - Justifies key design decisions
   - Analyzes tradeoffs and alternatives
   - Documents safety margins and limits
   - Example: `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_1_0_3_BETA2.md`

3. **Test Report**
   - Documents test coverage percentage
   - Lists all test results and pass/fail status
   - Example: `TEST_REPORT_1_0_3_BETA2.md`

4. **Compliance Clearance**
   - Sign-off from compliance review
   - Release can only proceed after clearance
   - Archived with package distribution

## Git Commits

### Commit 1: Establish T0-5 Policy

```text
governance: Establish T0-5 permanent policy - Framework Compliance Review Requirement

- Added T0-5 (Constitutional/Irreversible) policy requiring framework compliance review with every package release
- Compliance review now release-blocking requirement, not optional quality check
- CHANGELOG updated documenting governance change effective v1.0.3.beta2
- Policy formally classified in PRIORITY_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM.md with irreversible status
- This ensures all future releases meet compliance standards before deployment

Commit: c9e5332
Files: docs/architecture/PRIORITY_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM.md, CHANGELOG.md
```

### Commit 2: Correct T0-5 Reference

```text
docs: Correct T0-5 policy reference in copilot-instructions.md

- Updated from incorrect T0-1 label to correct T0-5 designation
- Expanded policy description to include release-blocking requirement
- Policy now consistently referenced as T0-5 across all governance documents
- Enhanced description explains Constitutional (Irreversible) tier classification

Files: .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

## Verification Checklist

-  T0-5 added to PRIORITY_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM.md (Tier 0 Policies)
-  T0-5 documented in .github/copilot-instructions.md (Persistent Policies)
-  CHANGELOG.md updated with governance change
-  Policy correctly labeled as Constitutional (T0) tier
-  Policy includes "release-blocking requirement" language
-  Git commits document establishment with proper messages
-  Consistency verified across all governance documents
-  User directive fully implemented: permanent + required + classified in tier system

## Enforcement

### Release Pipeline Integration

Before any package release:

1. Run comprehensive compliance review (T0-5 requirement)
2. Create compliance review document
3. Document technical debt assessment
4. Verify SECURITY > EFFICIENCY > MINIMALISM alignment
5. Obtain compliance clearance
6. Archive compliance artifacts with distribution
7. Release only after clearance obtained

### Violations

Releasing without compliance review:

- Constitutional violation (T0 tier)
- Requires immediate investigation
- Subject to branch rollback
- Triggers security audit

## Success Metrics

-  Policy established as irreversible (T0 classification)
-  Policy enforced in governance documents
-  Future releases will include mandatory compliance review
-  v1.0.3.beta2 includes compliance artifacts (proof of concept)
-  Prevents regression to beta1-style deployments without compliance

## Next Release Requirements

For v1.0.3 (production) or any future releases:

1.  Comprehensive framework compliance review (REQUIRED per T0-5)
2.  Technical architecture review (REQUIRED per T0-5)
3.  Complete test report (REQUIRED per T0-5)
4.  Zero technical debt regression (REQUIRED per T0-5)
5.  All artifacts archived with distribution (REQUIRED per T0-5)
6.  Release only proceeds after compliance clearance (REQUIRED per T0-5)

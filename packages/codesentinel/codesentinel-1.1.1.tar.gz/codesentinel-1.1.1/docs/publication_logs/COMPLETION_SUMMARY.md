   - Includes deployment readiness checklist

8. **Workspace Organization Scan** (Task 8/10)
   -  Main test files: /tests/ directory (properly organized)
   -  Legacy test files: /quarantine_legacy_archive/ (archived)

10. **Approval Checkpoint** (Task 10/10)
    - ⏸ PAUSED FOR USER REVIEW
    - All pre-packaging tasks complete

```
SECURITY.md            - Documentation example (verified false positive)
gui_wizard_v2.py       - Config placeholder (verified false positive)
test_install_env       - Virtual environment (verified false positive)

```

**Status:**  System is efficient

### Minimalism (2 Items)

```

## Performance Characteristics

| Component | Time | Memory | Assessment |
|-----------|------|--------|------------|
| FileIntegrity Generate | 0.6s | 0.51MB |  EXCELLENT |
| FileIntegrity Verify | 0.6s | 0.18MB |  EXCELLENT |
| ProcessMonitor | 119ms | 0.12MB |  GOOD |
| ConfigManager | 2.2ms | 0.05MB |  EXCELLENT |
| DevAudit Brief | 13.5s | 0.36MB |  HIGH (95% of total) |
| **Total System** | **14.2s** | **1.02MB** | ** HIGH (due to DevAudit)** |

**Key Finding:** FileIntegrity system is excellent. DevAudit brief mode (13.5s) is primary bottleneck - consider optimization for v1.1.0.

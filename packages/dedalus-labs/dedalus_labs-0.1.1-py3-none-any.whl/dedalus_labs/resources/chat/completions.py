        Create a chat completion.

        Unified chat-completions endpoint that works across many model providers.
        Supports optional MCP integration, multi-model routing with agentic handoffs,
        server- or client-executed tools, and both streaming and non-streaming delivery.

        Request body:

        - messages: ordered list of chat turns.
        - model: identifier or a list of identifiers for routing.
        - tools: optional tool declarations available to the model.
        - mcp_servers: optional list of MCP server slugs to enable during the run.
        - stream: boolean to request incremental output.
        - config: optional generation parameters (e.g., temperature, max_tokens,
          metadata).

        Headers:

        - Authorization: bearer key for the calling account.
        - Optional BYOK or provider headers if applicable.

        Behavior:

        - If multiple models are supplied, the router may select or hand off across
          them.
        - Tools may be invoked on the server or signaled for the client to run.
        - Streaming responses emit incremental deltas; non-streaming returns a single
          object.
        - Usage metrics are computed when available and returned in the response.

        Responses:

        - 200 OK: JSON completion object with choices, message content, and usage.
        - 400 Bad Request: validation error.
        - 401 Unauthorized: authentication failed.
        - 402 Payment Required or 429 Too Many Requests: quota, balance, or rate limit
          issue.
        - 500 Internal Server Error: unexpected failure.

        Billing:

        - Token usage metered by the selected model(s).
        - Tool calls and MCP sessions may be billed separately.
        - Streaming is settled after the stream ends via an async task.

        Example (non-streaming HTTP): POST /v1/chat/completions Content-Type:
        application/json Authorization: Bearer <key>

        { "model": "provider/model-name", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content":
        "Hello"}] }

        200 OK { "id": "cmpl_123", "object": "chat.completion", "choices": [ {"index":
        0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}, "finish_reason":
        "stop"} ], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3, "completion_tokens": 4, "total_tokens":
        7} }

        Example (streaming over SSE): POST /v1/chat/completions Accept:
        text/event-stream

        data: {"id":"cmpl_123","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hi"}}]} data:
        {"id":"cmpl_123","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" there!"}}]} data:
        [DONE]

        Args:
          model: Model(s) to use for completion. Can be a single model ID, a DedalusModel object,
              or a list for multi-model routing. Single model: 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', or a DedalusModel
              instance. Multi-model routing: ['openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'] or list of DedalusModel objects - agent will
              choose optimal model based on task complexity.

          agent_attributes: Attributes for the agent itself, influencing behavior and model selection.
              Format: {'attribute': value}, where values are 0.0-1.0. Common attributes:
              'complexity', 'accuracy', 'efficiency', 'creativity', 'friendliness'. Higher
              values indicate stronger preference for that characteristic.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when requesting audio responses (for
              example, modalities including 'audio').

          auto_execute_tools: When False, skip server-side tool execution and return raw OpenAI-style
              tool_calls in the response.

          deferred: xAI-specific parameter. If set to true, the request returns a request_id for
              async completion retrieval via GET /v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id}.

          disable_automatic_function_calling: Google-only flag to disable the SDK's automatic function execution. When true,
              the model returns function calls for the client to execute manually.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of 'tool_choice'. Controls which function is called by the
              model (none, auto, or specific name).

          functions: Deprecated in favor of 'tools'. Legacy list of function definitions the model
              may generate JSON inputs for.

          generation_config: Google generationConfig object. Merged with auto-generated config. Use for
              Google-specific params (candidateCount, responseMimeType, etc.).

          guardrails: Guardrails to apply to the agent for input/output validation and safety checks.
              Reserved for future use - guardrails configuration format not yet finalized.

          handoff_config: Configuration for multi-model handoffs and agent orchestration. Reserved for
              future use - handoff configuration format not yet finalized.

          input: Convenience alias for Responses-style `input`. Used when `messages` is omitted
              to provide the user prompt directly.

          instructions: Convenience alias for Responses-style `instructions`. Takes precedence over
              `system` and over system-role messages when provided.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
              JSON object mapping token IDs (as strings) to bias values from -100 to 100. The
              bias is added to the logits before sampling; values between -1 and 1 nudge
              selection probability, while values like -100 or 100 effectively ban or require
              a token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the
              log probabilities for each token in the response content.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This
              value can be used to control costs for text generated via API. This value is now
              deprecated in favor of 'max_completion_tokens' and is not compatible with
              o-series models.

          max_turns: Maximum number of turns for agent execution before terminating (default: 10).
              Each turn represents one model inference cycle. Higher values allow more complex
              reasoning but increase cost and latency.

          mcp_servers: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server addresses to make available for server-side
              tool execution. Entries can be URLs (e.g., 'https://mcp.example.com'), slugs
              (e.g., 'dedalus-labs/brave-search'), or structured objects specifying
              slug/version/url. MCP tools are executed server-side and billed separately.

          messages: Conversation history. Accepts either a list of message objects or a string,
              which is treated as a single user message. Optional if `input` or `instructions`
              is provided.

          metadata: Set of up to 16 key-value string pairs that can be attached to the request for
              structured metadata.

          modalities: Output types you would like the model to generate. Most models default to
              ['text']; some support ['text', 'audio'].

          model_attributes: Attributes for individual models used in routing decisions during multi-model
              execution. Format: {'model_name': {'attribute': value}}, where values are
              0.0-1.0. Common attributes: 'intelligence', 'speed', 'cost', 'creativity',
              'accuracy'. Used by agent to select optimal model based on task requirements.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Keep 'n' as
              1 to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

          prediction: Configuration for predicted outputs. Improves response times when you already
              know large portions of the response content.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          prompt_cache_key: Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests and optimize cache hit
              rates. Replaces the legacy 'user' field for caching.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for supported reasoning models. Higher values use
              more compute, potentially improving reasoning quality at the cost of latency and
              tokens.

          response_format:
              An object specifying the format that the model must output. Use {'type':
              'json_schema', 'json_schema': {...}} for structured outputs or {'type':
              'json_object'} for the legacy JSON mode. Currently only OpenAI-prefixed models
              honour this field; Anthropic and Google requests will return an
              invalid_request_error if it is supplied.

          safety_identifier: Stable identifier used to help detect users who might violate OpenAI usage
              policies. Consider hashing end-user identifiers before sending.

          safety_settings: Google safety settings (harm categories and thresholds).

          search_parameters: xAI-specific parameter for configuring web search data acquisition. If not set,
              no data will be acquired by the model.

          seed: If specified, system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.
              Determinism is not guaranteed for the same seed across different models or API
              versions.

          service_tier: Specifies the processing tier used for the request. 'auto' uses project
              defaults, while 'default' forces standard pricing and performance.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models 'o3' and 'o4-mini'.

                      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens; the returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether to store the output of this chat completion request for OpenAI model
              distillation or eval products. Image inputs over 8MB are dropped if storage is
              enabled.

          stream: If true, the model response data is streamed to the client as it is generated
              using Server-Sent Events.

          stream_options: Options for streaming responses. Only set when 'stream' is true (supports
              'include_usage' and 'include_obfuscation').

          system: System prompt/instructions. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: converted to
              systemInstruction. OpenAI: extracted from messages.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
              the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
              deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or 'top_p' but not both.

          thinking: Extended thinking configuration (Anthropic only). Enables thinking blocks
              showing reasoning process. Requires min 1,024 token budget.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' stops tool calling,
              'auto' lets the model decide, and 'required' forces at least one tool
              invocation. Specific tool payloads force that tool.

          tool_config: Google tool configuration (function calling mode, etc.).

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Supports OpenAI function tools and custom
              tools; use 'mcp_servers' for Dedalus-managed server-side tools.

          top_k: Top-k sampling. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: injected into
              generationConfig.topK.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying how many of the most likely tokens to
              return at each position, with log probabilities. Requires 'logprobs' to be true.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or 'temperature' but not both.

          user: Stable identifier for your end-users. Helps OpenAI detect and prevent abuse and
              may boost cache hit rates. This field is being replaced by 'safety_identifier'
              and 'prompt_cache_key'.

          verbosity: Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values produce concise
              answers, higher values allow more detail.

          web_search_options: Configuration for OpenAI's web search tool. Learn more at
              https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

        [DONE]

        Args:
          model: Model(s) to use for completion. Can be a single model ID, a DedalusModel object,
              or a list for multi-model routing. Single model: 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', or a DedalusModel
              instance. Multi-model routing: ['openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'] or list of DedalusModel objects - agent will
              choose optimal model based on task complexity.

          stream: If true, the model response data is streamed to the client as it is generated
              using Server-Sent Events.

          agent_attributes: Attributes for the agent itself, influencing behavior and model selection.
              Format: {'attribute': value}, where values are 0.0-1.0. Common attributes:
              'complexity', 'accuracy', 'efficiency', 'creativity', 'friendliness'. Higher
              values indicate stronger preference for that characteristic.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when requesting audio responses (for
              example, modalities including 'audio').

          auto_execute_tools: When False, skip server-side tool execution and return raw OpenAI-style
              tool_calls in the response.

          deferred: xAI-specific parameter. If set to true, the request returns a request_id for
              async completion retrieval via GET /v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id}.

          disable_automatic_function_calling: Google-only flag to disable the SDK's automatic function execution. When true,
              the model returns function calls for the client to execute manually.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of 'tool_choice'. Controls which function is called by the
              model (none, auto, or specific name).

          functions: Deprecated in favor of 'tools'. Legacy list of function definitions the model
              may generate JSON inputs for.

          generation_config: Google generationConfig object. Merged with auto-generated config. Use for
              Google-specific params (candidateCount, responseMimeType, etc.).

          guardrails: Guardrails to apply to the agent for input/output validation and safety checks.
              Reserved for future use - guardrails configuration format not yet finalized.

          handoff_config: Configuration for multi-model handoffs and agent orchestration. Reserved for
              future use - handoff configuration format not yet finalized.

          input: Convenience alias for Responses-style `input`. Used when `messages` is omitted
              to provide the user prompt directly.

          instructions: Convenience alias for Responses-style `instructions`. Takes precedence over
              `system` and over system-role messages when provided.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
              JSON object mapping token IDs (as strings) to bias values from -100 to 100. The
              bias is added to the logits before sampling; values between -1 and 1 nudge
              selection probability, while values like -100 or 100 effectively ban or require
              a token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the
              log probabilities for each token in the response content.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This
              value can be used to control costs for text generated via API. This value is now
              deprecated in favor of 'max_completion_tokens' and is not compatible with
              o-series models.

          max_turns: Maximum number of turns for agent execution before terminating (default: 10).
              Each turn represents one model inference cycle. Higher values allow more complex
              reasoning but increase cost and latency.

          mcp_servers: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server addresses to make available for server-side
              tool execution. Entries can be URLs (e.g., 'https://mcp.example.com'), slugs
              (e.g., 'dedalus-labs/brave-search'), or structured objects specifying
              slug/version/url. MCP tools are executed server-side and billed separately.

          messages: Conversation history. Accepts either a list of message objects or a string,
              which is treated as a single user message. Optional if `input` or `instructions`
              is provided.

          metadata: Set of up to 16 key-value string pairs that can be attached to the request for
              structured metadata.

          modalities: Output types you would like the model to generate. Most models default to
              ['text']; some support ['text', 'audio'].

          model_attributes: Attributes for individual models used in routing decisions during multi-model
              execution. Format: {'model_name': {'attribute': value}}, where values are
              0.0-1.0. Common attributes: 'intelligence', 'speed', 'cost', 'creativity',
              'accuracy'. Used by agent to select optimal model based on task requirements.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Keep 'n' as
              1 to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

          prediction: Configuration for predicted outputs. Improves response times when you already
              know large portions of the response content.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          prompt_cache_key: Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests and optimize cache hit
              rates. Replaces the legacy 'user' field for caching.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for supported reasoning models. Higher values use
              more compute, potentially improving reasoning quality at the cost of latency and
              tokens.

          response_format:
              An object specifying the format that the model must output. Use {'type':
              'json_schema', 'json_schema': {...}} for structured outputs or {'type':
              'json_object'} for the legacy JSON mode. Currently only OpenAI-prefixed models
              honour this field; Anthropic and Google requests will return an
              invalid_request_error if it is supplied.

          safety_identifier: Stable identifier used to help detect users who might violate OpenAI usage
              policies. Consider hashing end-user identifiers before sending.

          safety_settings: Google safety settings (harm categories and thresholds).

          search_parameters: xAI-specific parameter for configuring web search data acquisition. If not set,
              no data will be acquired by the model.

          seed: If specified, system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.
              Determinism is not guaranteed for the same seed across different models or API
              versions.

          service_tier: Specifies the processing tier used for the request. 'auto' uses project
              defaults, while 'default' forces standard pricing and performance.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models 'o3' and 'o4-mini'.

                      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens; the returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether to store the output of this chat completion request for OpenAI model
              distillation or eval products. Image inputs over 8MB are dropped if storage is
              enabled.

          stream_options: Options for streaming responses. Only set when 'stream' is true (supports
              'include_usage' and 'include_obfuscation').

          system: System prompt/instructions. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: converted to
              systemInstruction. OpenAI: extracted from messages.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
              the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
              deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or 'top_p' but not both.

          thinking: Extended thinking configuration (Anthropic only). Enables thinking blocks
              showing reasoning process. Requires min 1,024 token budget.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' stops tool calling,
              'auto' lets the model decide, and 'required' forces at least one tool
              invocation. Specific tool payloads force that tool.

          tool_config: Google tool configuration (function calling mode, etc.).

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Supports OpenAI function tools and custom
              tools; use 'mcp_servers' for Dedalus-managed server-side tools.

          top_k: Top-k sampling. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: injected into
              generationConfig.topK.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying how many of the most likely tokens to
              return at each position, with log probabilities. Requires 'logprobs' to be true.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or 'temperature' but not both.

          user: Stable identifier for your end-users. Helps OpenAI detect and prevent abuse and
              may boost cache hit rates. This field is being replaced by 'safety_identifier'
              and 'prompt_cache_key'.

          verbosity: Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values produce concise
              answers, higher values allow more detail.

          web_search_options: Configuration for OpenAI's web search tool. Learn more at
              https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

              or a list for multi-model routing. Single model: 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', or a DedalusModel
              instance. Multi-model routing: ['openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'] or list of DedalusModel objects - agent will
              choose optimal model based on task complexity.

          stream: If true, the model response data is streamed to the client as it is generated
              using Server-Sent Events.

          agent_attributes: Attributes for the agent itself, influencing behavior and model selection.
              Format: {'attribute': value}, where values are 0.0-1.0. Common attributes:
              'complexity', 'accuracy', 'efficiency', 'creativity', 'friendliness'. Higher
              values indicate stronger preference for that characteristic.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when requesting audio responses (for
              example, modalities including 'audio').

          auto_execute_tools: When False, skip server-side tool execution and return raw OpenAI-style
              tool_calls in the response.

          deferred: xAI-specific parameter. If set to true, the request returns a request_id for
              async completion retrieval via GET /v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id}.

          disable_automatic_function_calling: Google-only flag to disable the SDK's automatic function execution. When true,
              the model returns function calls for the client to execute manually.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of 'tool_choice'. Controls which function is called by the
              model (none, auto, or specific name).

          functions: Deprecated in favor of 'tools'. Legacy list of function definitions the model
              may generate JSON inputs for.

          generation_config: Google generationConfig object. Merged with auto-generated config. Use for
              Google-specific params (candidateCount, responseMimeType, etc.).

          guardrails: Guardrails to apply to the agent for input/output validation and safety checks.
              Reserved for future use - guardrails configuration format not yet finalized.

          handoff_config: Configuration for multi-model handoffs and agent orchestration. Reserved for
              future use - handoff configuration format not yet finalized.

          input: Convenience alias for Responses-style `input`. Used when `messages` is omitted
              to provide the user prompt directly.

          instructions: Convenience alias for Responses-style `instructions`. Takes precedence over
              `system` and over system-role messages when provided.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
              JSON object mapping token IDs (as strings) to bias values from -100 to 100. The
              bias is added to the logits before sampling; values between -1 and 1 nudge
              selection probability, while values like -100 or 100 effectively ban or require
              a token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the
              log probabilities for each token in the response content.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This
              value can be used to control costs for text generated via API. This value is now
              deprecated in favor of 'max_completion_tokens' and is not compatible with
              o-series models.

          max_turns: Maximum number of turns for agent execution before terminating (default: 10).
              Each turn represents one model inference cycle. Higher values allow more complex
              reasoning but increase cost and latency.

          mcp_servers: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server addresses to make available for server-side
              tool execution. Entries can be URLs (e.g., 'https://mcp.example.com'), slugs
              (e.g., 'dedalus-labs/brave-search'), or structured objects specifying
              slug/version/url. MCP tools are executed server-side and billed separately.

          messages: Conversation history. Accepts either a list of message objects or a string,
              which is treated as a single user message. Optional if `input` or `instructions`
              is provided.

          metadata: Set of up to 16 key-value string pairs that can be attached to the request for
              structured metadata.

          modalities: Output types you would like the model to generate. Most models default to
              ['text']; some support ['text', 'audio'].

          model_attributes: Attributes for individual models used in routing decisions during multi-model
              execution. Format: {'model_name': {'attribute': value}}, where values are
              0.0-1.0. Common attributes: 'intelligence', 'speed', 'cost', 'creativity',
              'accuracy'. Used by agent to select optimal model based on task requirements.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Keep 'n' as
              1 to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

          prediction: Configuration for predicted outputs. Improves response times when you already
              know large portions of the response content.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          prompt_cache_key: Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests and optimize cache hit
              rates. Replaces the legacy 'user' field for caching.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for supported reasoning models. Higher values use
              more compute, potentially improving reasoning quality at the cost of latency and
              tokens.

          response_format:
              An object specifying the format that the model must output. Use {'type':
              'json_schema', 'json_schema': {...}} for structured outputs or {'type':
              'json_object'} for the legacy JSON mode. Currently only OpenAI-prefixed models
              honour this field; Anthropic and Google requests will return an
              invalid_request_error if it is supplied.

          safety_identifier: Stable identifier used to help detect users who might violate OpenAI usage
              policies. Consider hashing end-user identifiers before sending.

          safety_settings: Google safety settings (harm categories and thresholds).

          search_parameters: xAI-specific parameter for configuring web search data acquisition. If not set,
              no data will be acquired by the model.

          seed: If specified, system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.
              Determinism is not guaranteed for the same seed across different models or API
              versions.

          service_tier: Specifies the processing tier used for the request. 'auto' uses project
              defaults, while 'default' forces standard pricing and performance.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models 'o3' and 'o4-mini'.

                      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens; the returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether to store the output of this chat completion request for OpenAI model
              distillation or eval products. Image inputs over 8MB are dropped if storage is
              enabled.

          stream_options: Options for streaming responses. Only set when 'stream' is true (supports
              'include_usage' and 'include_obfuscation').

          system: System prompt/instructions. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: converted to
              systemInstruction. OpenAI: extracted from messages.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
              the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
              deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or 'top_p' but not both.

          thinking: Extended thinking configuration (Anthropic only). Enables thinking blocks
              showing reasoning process. Requires min 1,024 token budget.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' stops tool calling,
              'auto' lets the model decide, and 'required' forces at least one tool
              invocation. Specific tool payloads force that tool.

          tool_config: Google tool configuration (function calling mode, etc.).

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Supports OpenAI function tools and custom
              tools; use 'mcp_servers' for Dedalus-managed server-side tools.

          top_k: Top-k sampling. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: injected into
              generationConfig.topK.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying how many of the most likely tokens to
              return at each position, with log probabilities. Requires 'logprobs' to be true.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or 'temperature' but not both.

          user: Stable identifier for your end-users. Helps OpenAI detect and prevent abuse and
              may boost cache hit rates. This field is being replaced by 'safety_identifier'
              and 'prompt_cache_key'.

          verbosity: Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values produce concise
              answers, higher values allow more detail.

          web_search_options: Configuration for OpenAI's web search tool. Learn more at
              https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Create a chat completion.

        Unified chat-completions endpoint that works across many model providers.
        Supports optional MCP integration, multi-model routing with agentic handoffs,
        server- or client-executed tools, and both streaming and non-streaming delivery.

        Request body:

        - messages: ordered list of chat turns.
        - model: identifier or a list of identifiers for routing.
        - tools: optional tool declarations available to the model.
        - mcp_servers: optional list of MCP server slugs to enable during the run.
        - stream: boolean to request incremental output.
        - config: optional generation parameters (e.g., temperature, max_tokens,
          metadata).

        Headers:

        - Authorization: bearer key for the calling account.
        - Optional BYOK or provider headers if applicable.

        Behavior:

        - If multiple models are supplied, the router may select or hand off across
          them.
        - Tools may be invoked on the server or signaled for the client to run.
        - Streaming responses emit incremental deltas; non-streaming returns a single
          object.
        - Usage metrics are computed when available and returned in the response.

        Responses:

        - 200 OK: JSON completion object with choices, message content, and usage.
        - 400 Bad Request: validation error.
        - 401 Unauthorized: authentication failed.
        - 402 Payment Required or 429 Too Many Requests: quota, balance, or rate limit
          issue.
        - 500 Internal Server Error: unexpected failure.

        Billing:

        - Token usage metered by the selected model(s).
        - Tool calls and MCP sessions may be billed separately.
        - Streaming is settled after the stream ends via an async task.

        Example (non-streaming HTTP): POST /v1/chat/completions Content-Type:
        application/json Authorization: Bearer <key>

        { "model": "provider/model-name", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content":

        [DONE]

        Args:
          model: Model(s) to use for completion. Can be a single model ID, a DedalusModel object,
              or a list for multi-model routing. Single model: 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', or a DedalusModel
              instance. Multi-model routing: ['openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'] or list of DedalusModel objects - agent will
              choose optimal model based on task complexity.

          agent_attributes: Attributes for the agent itself, influencing behavior and model selection.
              Format: {'attribute': value}, where values are 0.0-1.0. Common attributes:
              'complexity', 'accuracy', 'efficiency', 'creativity', 'friendliness'. Higher
              values indicate stronger preference for that characteristic.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when requesting audio responses (for
              example, modalities including 'audio').

          auto_execute_tools: When False, skip server-side tool execution and return raw OpenAI-style
              tool_calls in the response.

          deferred: xAI-specific parameter. If set to true, the request returns a request_id for
              async completion retrieval via GET /v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id}.

          disable_automatic_function_calling: Google-only flag to disable the SDK's automatic function execution. When true,
              the model returns function calls for the client to execute manually.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of 'tool_choice'. Controls which function is called by the
              model (none, auto, or specific name).

          functions: Deprecated in favor of 'tools'. Legacy list of function definitions the model
              may generate JSON inputs for.

          generation_config: Google generationConfig object. Merged with auto-generated config. Use for
              Google-specific params (candidateCount, responseMimeType, etc.).

          guardrails: Guardrails to apply to the agent for input/output validation and safety checks.
              Reserved for future use - guardrails configuration format not yet finalized.

          handoff_config: Configuration for multi-model handoffs and agent orchestration. Reserved for
              future use - handoff configuration format not yet finalized.

          input: Convenience alias for Responses-style `input`. Used when `messages` is omitted
              to provide the user prompt directly.

          instructions: Convenience alias for Responses-style `instructions`. Takes precedence over
              `system` and over system-role messages when provided.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
              JSON object mapping token IDs (as strings) to bias values from -100 to 100. The
              bias is added to the logits before sampling; values between -1 and 1 nudge
              selection probability, while values like -100 or 100 effectively ban or require
              a token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the
              log probabilities for each token in the response content.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This
              value can be used to control costs for text generated via API. This value is now
              deprecated in favor of 'max_completion_tokens' and is not compatible with
              o-series models.

          max_turns: Maximum number of turns for agent execution before terminating (default: 10).
              Each turn represents one model inference cycle. Higher values allow more complex
              reasoning but increase cost and latency.

          mcp_servers: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server addresses to make available for server-side
              tool execution. Entries can be URLs (e.g., 'https://mcp.example.com'), slugs
              (e.g., 'dedalus-labs/brave-search'), or structured objects specifying
              slug/version/url. MCP tools are executed server-side and billed separately.

          messages: Conversation history. Accepts either a list of message objects or a string,
              which is treated as a single user message. Optional if `input` or `instructions`
              is provided.

          metadata: Set of up to 16 key-value string pairs that can be attached to the request for
              structured metadata.

          modalities: Output types you would like the model to generate. Most models default to
              ['text']; some support ['text', 'audio'].

          model_attributes: Attributes for individual models used in routing decisions during multi-model
              execution. Format: {'model_name': {'attribute': value}}, where values are
              0.0-1.0. Common attributes: 'intelligence', 'speed', 'cost', 'creativity',
              'accuracy'. Used by agent to select optimal model based on task requirements.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Keep 'n' as
              1 to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

          prediction: Configuration for predicted outputs. Improves response times when you already
              know large portions of the response content.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          prompt_cache_key: Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests and optimize cache hit
              rates. Replaces the legacy 'user' field for caching.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for supported reasoning models. Higher values use
              more compute, potentially improving reasoning quality at the cost of latency and
              tokens.

          response_format:
              An object specifying the format that the model must output. Use {'type':
              'json_schema', 'json_schema': {...}} for structured outputs or {'type':
              'json_object'} for the legacy JSON mode. Currently only OpenAI-prefixed models
              honour this field; Anthropic and Google requests will return an
              invalid_request_error if it is supplied.

          safety_identifier: Stable identifier used to help detect users who might violate OpenAI usage
              policies. Consider hashing end-user identifiers before sending.

          safety_settings: Google safety settings (harm categories and thresholds).

          search_parameters: xAI-specific parameter for configuring web search data acquisition. If not set,
              no data will be acquired by the model.

          seed: If specified, system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.
              Determinism is not guaranteed for the same seed across different models or API
              versions.

          service_tier: Specifies the processing tier used for the request. 'auto' uses project
              defaults, while 'default' forces standard pricing and performance.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models 'o3' and 'o4-mini'.

                      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens; the returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether to store the output of this chat completion request for OpenAI model
              distillation or eval products. Image inputs over 8MB are dropped if storage is
              enabled.

          stream: If true, the model response data is streamed to the client as it is generated
              using Server-Sent Events.

          stream_options: Options for streaming responses. Only set when 'stream' is true (supports
              'include_usage' and 'include_obfuscation').

          system: System prompt/instructions. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: converted to
              systemInstruction. OpenAI: extracted from messages.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
              the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
              deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or 'top_p' but not both.

          thinking: Extended thinking configuration (Anthropic only). Enables thinking blocks
              showing reasoning process. Requires min 1,024 token budget.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' stops tool calling,
              'auto' lets the model decide, and 'required' forces at least one tool
              invocation. Specific tool payloads force that tool.

          tool_config: Google tool configuration (function calling mode, etc.).

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Supports OpenAI function tools and custom
              tools; use 'mcp_servers' for Dedalus-managed server-side tools.

          top_k: Top-k sampling. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: injected into
              generationConfig.topK.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying how many of the most likely tokens to
              return at each position, with log probabilities. Requires 'logprobs' to be true.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or 'temperature' but not both.

          user: Stable identifier for your end-users. Helps OpenAI detect and prevent abuse and
              may boost cache hit rates. This field is being replaced by 'safety_identifier'
              and 'prompt_cache_key'.

          verbosity: Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values produce concise
              answers, higher values allow more detail.

          web_search_options: Configuration for OpenAI's web search tool. Learn more at
              https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        [DONE]

        Args:
          model: Model(s) to use for completion. Can be a single model ID, a DedalusModel object,
              or a list for multi-model routing. Single model: 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', or a DedalusModel
              instance. Multi-model routing: ['openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'openai/gpt-4',

              using Server-Sent Events.

          agent_attributes: Attributes for the agent itself, influencing behavior and model selection.
              Format: {'attribute': value}, where values are 0.0-1.0. Common attributes:
              'complexity', 'accuracy', 'efficiency', 'creativity', 'friendliness'. Higher

          disable_automatic_function_calling: Google-only flag to disable the SDK's automatic function execution. When true,
              the model returns function calls for the client to execute manually.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of 'tool_choice'. Controls which function is called by the
              model (none, auto, or specific name).

          functions: Deprecated in favor of 'tools'. Legacy list of function definitions the model
              may generate JSON inputs for.

          generation_config: Google generationConfig object. Merged with auto-generated config. Use for
              Google-specific params (candidateCount, responseMimeType, etc.).

          guardrails: Guardrails to apply to the agent for input/output validation and safety checks.
              Reserved for future use - guardrails configuration format not yet finalized.

          handoff_config: Configuration for multi-model handoffs and agent orchestration. Reserved for
              future use - handoff configuration format not yet finalized.

          input: Convenience alias for Responses-style `input`. Used when `messages` is omitted
              to provide the user prompt directly.

          instructions: Convenience alias for Responses-style `instructions`. Takes precedence over
              `system` and over system-role messages when provided.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
              JSON object mapping token IDs (as strings) to bias values from -100 to 100. The
              bias is added to the logits before sampling; values between -1 and 1 nudge
              selection probability, while values like -100 or 100 effectively ban or require
              a token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the
              log probabilities for each token in the response content.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This
              value can be used to control costs for text generated via API. This value is now
              deprecated in favor of 'max_completion_tokens' and is not compatible with
              o-series models.

          max_turns: Maximum number of turns for agent execution before terminating (default: 10).
              Each turn represents one model inference cycle. Higher values allow more complex
              reasoning but increase cost and latency.

          mcp_servers: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server addresses to make available for server-side
              tool execution. Entries can be URLs (e.g., 'https://mcp.example.com'), slugs
              (e.g., 'dedalus-labs/brave-search'), or structured objects specifying
              slug/version/url. MCP tools are executed server-side and billed separately.

          messages: Conversation history. Accepts either a list of message objects or a string,
              which is treated as a single user message. Optional if `input` or `instructions`
              is provided.

          metadata: Set of up to 16 key-value string pairs that can be attached to the request for
              structured metadata.

          modalities: Output types you would like the model to generate. Most models default to
              ['text']; some support ['text', 'audio'].

          model_attributes: Attributes for individual models used in routing decisions during multi-model
              execution. Format: {'model_name': {'attribute': value}}, where values are
              0.0-1.0. Common attributes: 'intelligence', 'speed', 'cost', 'creativity',
              'accuracy'. Used by agent to select optimal model based on task requirements.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Keep 'n' as
              1 to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

          prediction: Configuration for predicted outputs. Improves response times when you already
              know large portions of the response content.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          prompt_cache_key: Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests and optimize cache hit
              rates. Replaces the legacy 'user' field for caching.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for supported reasoning models. Higher values use
              more compute, potentially improving reasoning quality at the cost of latency and
              tokens.

          response_format:
              An object specifying the format that the model must output. Use {'type':
              'json_schema', 'json_schema': {...}} for structured outputs or {'type':
              'json_object'} for the legacy JSON mode. Currently only OpenAI-prefixed models
              honour this field; Anthropic and Google requests will return an
              invalid_request_error if it is supplied.

          safety_identifier: Stable identifier used to help detect users who might violate OpenAI usage
              policies. Consider hashing end-user identifiers before sending.

          safety_settings: Google safety settings (harm categories and thresholds).

          search_parameters: xAI-specific parameter for configuring web search data acquisition. If not set,
              no data will be acquired by the model.

          seed: If specified, system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.
              Determinism is not guaranteed for the same seed across different models or API
              versions.

          service_tier: Specifies the processing tier used for the request. 'auto' uses project
              defaults, while 'default' forces standard pricing and performance.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models 'o3' and 'o4-mini'.

                      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens; the returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether to store the output of this chat completion request for OpenAI model
              distillation or eval products. Image inputs over 8MB are dropped if storage is
              enabled.

          stream_options: Options for streaming responses. Only set when 'stream' is true (supports
              'include_usage' and 'include_obfuscation').

          system: System prompt/instructions. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: converted to
              systemInstruction. OpenAI: extracted from messages.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
              the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
              deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or 'top_p' but not both.

          thinking: Extended thinking configuration (Anthropic only). Enables thinking blocks
              showing reasoning process. Requires min 1,024 token budget.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' stops tool calling,
              'auto' lets the model decide, and 'required' forces at least one tool
              invocation. Specific tool payloads force that tool.

          tool_config: Google tool configuration (function calling mode, etc.).

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Supports OpenAI function tools and custom
              tools; use 'mcp_servers' for Dedalus-managed server-side tools.

          top_k: Top-k sampling. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: injected into
              generationConfig.topK.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying how many of the most likely tokens to
              return at each position, with log probabilities. Requires 'logprobs' to be true.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or 'temperature' but not both.

          user: Stable identifier for your end-users. Helps OpenAI detect and prevent abuse and
              may boost cache hit rates. This field is being replaced by 'safety_identifier'
              and 'prompt_cache_key'.

          verbosity: Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values produce concise
              answers, higher values allow more detail.

          web_search_options: Configuration for OpenAI's web search tool. Learn more at
              https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

        Create a chat completion.

        Unified chat-completions endpoint that works across many model providers.
        Supports optional MCP integration, multi-model routing with agentic handoffs,
        server- or client-executed tools, and both streaming and non-streaming delivery.

        Request body:

        - messages: ordered list of chat turns.
        - model: identifier or a list of identifiers for routing.
        - tools: optional tool declarations available to the model.
        - mcp_servers: optional list of MCP server slugs to enable during the run.
        - stream: boolean to request incremental output.
        - config: optional generation parameters (e.g., temperature, max_tokens,
          metadata).

        Headers:

        - Authorization: bearer key for the calling account.
        - Optional BYOK or provider headers if applicable.

        Behavior:

        - If multiple models are supplied, the router may select or hand off across
          them.
        - Tools may be invoked on the server or signaled for the client to run.
        - Streaming responses emit incremental deltas; non-streaming returns a single
          object.
        - Usage metrics are computed when available and returned in the response.

        Responses:

        - 200 OK: JSON completion object with choices, message content, and usage.
        - 400 Bad Request: validation error.
        - 401 Unauthorized: authentication failed.
        - 402 Payment Required or 429 Too Many Requests: quota, balance, or rate limit
          issue.
        - 500 Internal Server Error: unexpected failure.

        Billing:

        - Token usage metered by the selected model(s).
        - Tool calls and MCP sessions may be billed separately.
        - Streaming is settled after the stream ends via an async task.

        Example (non-streaming HTTP): POST /v1/chat/completions Content-Type:
        application/json Authorization: Bearer <key>

        { "model": "provider/model-name", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content":
        "Hello"}] }

        200 OK { "id": "cmpl_123", "object": "chat.completion", "choices": [ {"index":
        0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}, "finish_reason":
        "stop"} ], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3, "completion_tokens": 4, "total_tokens":
        7} }

        Example (streaming over SSE): POST /v1/chat/completions Accept:
        text/event-stream

        data: {"id":"cmpl_123","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hi"}}]} data:
        {"id":"cmpl_123","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" there!"}}]} data:
        [DONE]

        Args:
          model: Model(s) to use for completion. Can be a single model ID, a DedalusModel object,
              or a list for multi-model routing. Single model: 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', or a DedalusModel
              instance. Multi-model routing: ['openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'openai/gpt-4',
              'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'] or list of DedalusModel objects - agent will
              choose optimal model based on task complexity.

          stream: If true, the model response data is streamed to the client as it is generated
              using Server-Sent Events.

          agent_attributes: Attributes for the agent itself, influencing behavior and model selection.
              Format: {'attribute': value}, where values are 0.0-1.0. Common attributes:
              'complexity', 'accuracy', 'efficiency', 'creativity', 'friendliness'. Higher
              values indicate stronger preference for that characteristic.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when requesting audio responses (for
              example, modalities including 'audio').

          auto_execute_tools: When False, skip server-side tool execution and return raw OpenAI-style
              tool_calls in the response.

          deferred: xAI-specific parameter. If set to true, the request returns a request_id for
              async completion retrieval via GET /v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id}.

          disable_automatic_function_calling: Google-only flag to disable the SDK's automatic function execution. When true,
              the model returns function calls for the client to execute manually.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of 'tool_choice'. Controls which function is called by the
              model (none, auto, or specific name).

          functions: Deprecated in favor of 'tools'. Legacy list of function definitions the model
              may generate JSON inputs for.

          generation_config: Google generationConfig object. Merged with auto-generated config. Use for
              Google-specific params (candidateCount, responseMimeType, etc.).

          guardrails: Guardrails to apply to the agent for input/output validation and safety checks.
              Reserved for future use - guardrails configuration format not yet finalized.

          handoff_config: Configuration for multi-model handoffs and agent orchestration. Reserved for
              future use - handoff configuration format not yet finalized.

          input: Convenience alias for Responses-style `input`. Used when `messages` is omitted
              to provide the user prompt directly.

          instructions: Convenience alias for Responses-style `instructions`. Takes precedence over
              `system` and over system-role messages when provided.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
              JSON object mapping token IDs (as strings) to bias values from -100 to 100. The
              bias is added to the logits before sampling; values between -1 and 1 nudge
              selection probability, while values like -100 or 100 effectively ban or require
              a token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the
              log probabilities for each token in the response content.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This
              value can be used to control costs for text generated via API. This value is now
              deprecated in favor of 'max_completion_tokens' and is not compatible with
              o-series models.

          max_turns: Maximum number of turns for agent execution before terminating (default: 10).
              Each turn represents one model inference cycle. Higher values allow more complex
              reasoning but increase cost and latency.

          mcp_servers: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server addresses to make available for server-side
              tool execution. Entries can be URLs (e.g., 'https://mcp.example.com'), slugs
              (e.g., 'dedalus-labs/brave-search'), or structured objects specifying
              slug/version/url. MCP tools are executed server-side and billed separately.

          messages: Conversation history. Accepts either a list of message objects or a string,
              which is treated as a single user message. Optional if `input` or `instructions`
              is provided.

          metadata: Set of up to 16 key-value string pairs that can be attached to the request for
              structured metadata.

          modalities: Output types you would like the model to generate. Most models default to
              ['text']; some support ['text', 'audio'].

          model_attributes: Attributes for individual models used in routing decisions during multi-model
              execution. Format: {'model_name': {'attribute': value}}, where values are
              0.0-1.0. Common attributes: 'intelligence', 'speed', 'cost', 'creativity',
              'accuracy'. Used by agent to select optimal model based on task requirements.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Keep 'n' as
              1 to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

          prediction: Configuration for predicted outputs. Improves response times when you already
              know large portions of the response content.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          prompt_cache_key: Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests and optimize cache hit
              rates. Replaces the legacy 'user' field for caching.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for supported reasoning models. Higher values use
              more compute, potentially improving reasoning quality at the cost of latency and
              tokens.

          response_format:
              An object specifying the format that the model must output. Use {'type':
              'json_schema', 'json_schema': {...}} for structured outputs or {'type':
              'json_object'} for the legacy JSON mode. Currently only OpenAI-prefixed models
              honour this field; Anthropic and Google requests will return an
              invalid_request_error if it is supplied.

          safety_identifier: Stable identifier used to help detect users who might violate OpenAI usage
              policies. Consider hashing end-user identifiers before sending.

          safety_settings: Google safety settings (harm categories and thresholds).

          search_parameters: xAI-specific parameter for configuring web search data acquisition. If not set,
              no data will be acquired by the model.

          seed: If specified, system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.
              Determinism is not guaranteed for the same seed across different models or API
              versions.

          service_tier: Specifies the processing tier used for the request. 'auto' uses project
              defaults, while 'default' forces standard pricing and performance.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models 'o3' and 'o4-mini'.

                      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens; the returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether to store the output of this chat completion request for OpenAI model
              distillation or eval products. Image inputs over 8MB are dropped if storage is
              enabled.

          stream_options: Options for streaming responses. Only set when 'stream' is true (supports
              'include_usage' and 'include_obfuscation').

          system: System prompt/instructions. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: converted to
              systemInstruction. OpenAI: extracted from messages.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
              the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
              deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or 'top_p' but not both.

          thinking: Extended thinking configuration (Anthropic only). Enables thinking blocks
              showing reasoning process. Requires min 1,024 token budget.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' stops tool calling,
              'auto' lets the model decide, and 'required' forces at least one tool
              invocation. Specific tool payloads force that tool.

          tool_config: Google tool configuration (function calling mode, etc.).

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Supports OpenAI function tools and custom
              tools; use 'mcp_servers' for Dedalus-managed server-side tools.

          top_k: Top-k sampling. Anthropic: pass-through. Google: injected into
              generationConfig.topK.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying how many of the most likely tokens to
              return at each position, with log probabilities. Requires 'logprobs' to be true.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or 'temperature' but not both.

          user: Stable identifier for your end-users. Helps OpenAI detect and prevent abuse and
              may boost cache hit rates. This field is being replaced by 'safety_identifier'
              and 'prompt_cache_key'.

          verbosity: Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values produce concise
              answers, higher values allow more detail.

          web_search_options: Configuration for OpenAI's web search tool. Learn more at
              https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

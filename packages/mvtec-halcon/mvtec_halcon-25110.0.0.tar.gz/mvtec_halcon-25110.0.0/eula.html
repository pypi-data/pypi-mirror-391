provisions below. Once you subscribe to the Progress Edition, your
subscription will be automatically renewed by the end of the
Subscription Term as long as you don’t terminate your subscription three
(3) months prior to the end of the Subscription Term. “Renew” shall mean
to apply the same length of the Subscription Term once again.</p>
<h4 id="software-configuration-options">2.3.3. Software Configuration
Options</h4>
<h5 id="evaluation-version">2.3.3.1. Evaluation Version</h5>
<p>The Evaluation Version is a version of the Software that allows you
to evaluate the full functionality of the Software for a certain period
of time, typically one (1) month. After the expiration of this time
period, the use of the Software is no longer allowed. The Evaluation
License requires a corresponding Evaluation License File.</p>
<p>Your right to use the Software and to create Derivatives is
restricted to the purpose of evaluating the Software. The use for
commercial purposes including the development of commercial applications
is not permitted.</p>
<h5 id="development-version">2.3.3.2. Development Version</h5>
<p>The Development Version is a version of the Software that allows you
to use the functionality of the Software as described in the
Documentation for a certain period of time. For the Steady Edition, the
period of time is unlimited; for the Progress Edition, the period of
time is the Subscription Term. The Development Version requires a valid
License File that permits you to use the Development Version. The scope
of your right to install and use the Development Version depends on the
License Type. In case of a Node-locked License the Software may only be
installed on the System specified in the License File, see Section 2.4,
or on a build system. You may use the Software to create Derivatives,
including commercial applications. In particular, you may use the
Development Version to compile and link applications.</p>
<h5 id="runtime-version">2.3.3.3. Runtime Version</h5>
<p>The Runtime Version is a version of the Software that allows you to
use the runtime functionality of the Software. In particular, certain
development tools of the Software cannot be used, as described in the
Documentation.</p>
<p>The Runtime Version requires a License File that permits you to use
the Runtime Version. The scope of your right to install and use the
Runtime Version depends on the License Type, see Section 2.4.</p>
<p>Your right to purchase the Runtime Version depends on the Edition.
The Steady Edition allows you to purchase the Runtime Version for an
unlimited period of time, provided that you own a corresponding
Development Version. The Progress Edition allows you to purchase the
Runtime Version only during the Subscription Term.</p>
<p>You may distribute and sublicense Derivatives. You must possess a
valid license for the Development Version before you are authorized to
distribute and/or sublicense your Derivatives. The Runtime Version may
not be used for the creation of Derivatives, including, but not limited
to, compiling, and linking of applications.</p>
<p>If you are authorized and choose to distribute such Derivatives, you
agree (1) not to use MVTec's name, logo or trademarks to market the
Derivatives; (2) to display your own valid copyright notice which shall
be sufficient to protect MVTec's copyright in the Software; (3) not to
remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or patent notice that appear
on the Software as delivered to you; (4) to accompany the Derivative
with a license whose terms and conditions are not in contradiction with
the terms in this Agreement; (5) to explicitly exclude MVTec and its
suppliers from all liability for damages or any obligation to provide
remedial actions that may result from the use and distribution of
Derivatives; (6) to indemnify, hold harmless and defend MVTec from and
against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or
result from your culpable use or distribution of the Derivatives; (7)
otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement; and (8) agree that
MVTec reserves all rights not expressly granted.</p>
<p>MVTec shall have no support or warranty obligations and disclaims all
liability, for Derivatives developed and/or distributed by you. In
particular, you will be solely responsible to your end users (or anyone
else who uses your Derivatives) for support, service, upgrades, or
technical or other assistance, and such persons will have no right to
contact MVTec for any services or assistance. Your rights with regard to
Software remain unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="license-types">2.4. License Types</h3>
<p>Any License Type requires that the corresponding License File is
installed on the System as explained in the Documentation. For
time-limited licenses, you agree that the System time must be
synchronized to the real-world time.</p>
<h4 id="node-locked-licenses">2.4.1. Node-locked Licenses</h4>
<p>A Node-locked License allows you to install and use the Software only
on the System specified in the License File, with the exception for the
Development Version specified in Section 2.3.3.2. The System is
specified by a Host ID that is bound to a connected hardware component.
The Host ID is bound to an irremovable computer component (Irremovable
Host ID), for example, a network card, or is bound to a removable
hardware component (Removable Host ID), for example, a dongle.</p>
<p>If you use an Irremovable Host ID for licensing the Software, you may
only install and use the Software on the System that is connected to the
Irremovable Host ID. If you use a Removable Host ID you may install the
Software on any number of Systems that are intended to run the Software,
but you may use the Software only on the System to which the Removable
Host ID is currently connected. You may not use the same Node-locked
License simultaneously on multiple Systems.</p>
<h4 id="network-licenses">2.4.2. Network Licenses</h4>
<p>A Network License allows you to install the Software on any number of
Systems that are intended to run the Software. However, a Network
License limits the number of simultaneous uses of the Software to the
number of licenses specified in the License File. The Network License
requires that a special program, the License Server, is licensed and
installed on one System in the network. The System running the License
Server is specified by a Host ID that is either bound to a dongle
(Removable Host ID) or from an UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
provided by the License Server license. The License Server may only be
executed on the System to which the Host ID is currently connected.</p>
<h3 id="compliance-with-licenses">2.5. Compliance with Licenses</h3>
<p>You undertake to keep true, accurate, and consistent books and
records containing regular entries relating to the use of the Software
and sales, distributions, or other transfers of Derivatives. MVTec, its
authorized representative, or its accountants (subject to your prior
written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) may, for the
purpose of confirming your compliance with the terms hereof, enter your
place of business on reasonable written notice, but not less than five
(5) business days, during normal business hours once per year during the
term of this Agreement and once following the termination or expiration
of this Agreement. MVTec, its authorized representative, or its
accountants shall be entitled to perform an audit of your relevant
books, records, and software systems, and receive any explanations that
may reasonably be requested. MVTec shall be responsible for its costs
incurred in connection with any such audit, provided that you shall
reimburse MVTec for the cost of the audit if the examination discloses
an underpayment to MVTec of more than ten percent (10%) of the payments
due with respect to any applicable period. Any further rights of MVTec
remain unaffected. This Section 2.5 shall survive any termination or
expiration of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.</p>
<p>You further agree that upon request from MVTec or MVTec's authorized
representative, you will within thirty (30) days fully document and
certify that the use of any and all Software at the time of the request
is in conformity with your valid licenses from MVTec.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">2.6. Documentation</h3>
<p>You may make and use a reasonable number of copies of any
Documentation, provided that such copies shall be used only for internal
purposes and are not to be republished or distributed (either in hard
copy or electronic form) beyond your premises. In particular, you may
not forward any Documentation to your customers as a part of
Derivatives.</p>
<h3 id="example-programs-and-licenses">2.7. Example Programs and
Licenses</h3>
<p>MVTec grants you the right to use and modify the example programs and
example images included in the Software for the sole purpose of
designing, developing, and testing your software product(s). Example
programs are stored in the directory "examples" in the directory or
directories in which you have installed the Software, while example
images are stored in the directory “examples/images”.</p>

other Rights and Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="rental">3.1. Rental</h3>
<p>You may not rent, lease, or lend the Software.</p>
<h3 id="backup-copy">3.2. Backup Copy</h3>
<p>You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software to backup
devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape solely to replace the
original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or
destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are
retained by MVTec.</p>
<h3
id="limitation-on-reverse-engineering-decompilation-disassembly-and-modification">3.3.
Limitation on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, Disassembly and
Modification</h3>
<p>You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise
attempt to discover the source code of the Software or the file format
or content of its Protected Data, unless you are explicitly permitted by
law to do so. If it is essential to do so in order to achieve
interoperability of the Software with other software programs, you shall
request MVTec to provide the information necessary to achieve such
interoperability and MVTec will provide such information upon mutual
consent.</p>
<p>MVTec has the right to impose reasonable conditions and to request a
reasonable fee before providing such information. Any information
supplied by MVTec or obtained by you, as permitted hereunder, may only
be used by you for the purpose described herein and may not be disclosed
to any third party.</p>
<p>You may not modify, adapt, or otherwise alter the Software or
Protected Data except as expressly permitted herein. In particular, you
may not attempt to remove the license protection mechanism from the
Software.</p>
<h3 id="trademarks">3.4. Trademarks</h3>
<p>This Agreement does not grant you any rights in connection with any
trademarks or service marks of MVTec. You may not use the name,
trademarks, or service marks of MVTec in any advertising, promotional
literature, or any other material, whether in written, electronic, or
other form, distributed to any third party, except as expressly
permitted by MVTec.</p>
<h3 id="upgrades">3.5. Upgrades</h3>
<p>Different rights and obligations apply to the Editions and Software
Configurations as listed in the following provisions.</p>
<h4 id="steady-edition-1">3.5.1. Steady Edition</h4>
<p>If the Software either in its Development Version or Runtime Version
is an upgrade to a previous version of the Software, you must possess a
valid license to such previous version in order to use the upgrade. You
may continue to use the previous version of the Software on your System

a valid license of the Runtime Version. In this case, you acknowledge
that any obligation MVTec may have to support a previous version of the
Runtime Version of the Software ends upon the availability of the
upgrade to such previous version.</p>
<h3 id="license-for-third-party-software">3.6. License for Third-Party
Software</h3>
<p>MVTec has been granted licenses to distribute certain third-party
software. As a condition of those licenses, MVTec is required to
distribute the software subject to specific terms and conditions, which
may be different from or additional to those contained herein for
MVTec's Software. All third-party software and the respective license
terms will be listed in the Documentation and will also be provided upon
request. The documentation also describes which third-party software is
used by which part of the Software. Your use of a certain part of the
Software requires that you accept the license terms of the third-party
software that is used by this part of the Software (the Used Third-Party
Software). You understand and agree that acceptance of this Agreement
also confirms your acceptance of the applicable provisions for use,
including the restrictions on use, of the Used Third-Party Software. Any
breach of the applicable provisions of any third-party's license terms
shall also be considered a material breach of this Agreement.</p>
<h3 id="expiration-of-the-right-of-use">3.7. Expiration of the Right of
Use</h3>
<p>As soon as the right to use the Software has ended, you must destroy
all copies of the Software.</p>
<h3 id="termination">3.8. Termination</h3>
<p>Without prejudice to any other rights, MVTec may terminate this
Agreement if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Software as
well as all Derivatives.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property-rights">4. Intellectual Property
Rights</h2>
<p>The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual
property laws and treaties. All title and intellectual property rights
in and to the Software, including, but not limited to, any digital
images or example programs, incorporated into the Software, the
Documentation, and any copies of the Software are owned by MVTec or its
suppliers. The Software is licensed, not sold.</p>
<h2 id="limited-warrenty">5. Limited Warrenty</h2>
<p>MVTec warrants to the person or entity that first purchases a license
for the Software that the Software will perform in all material aspects
in accordance with the Documentation for a period of twelve (12) months
following receipt of the Software when used on a recommended hardware
configuration. The warranty period shall be according to statutory law
in cases of intent or gross negligence on the part of MVTec.</p>
<p>Non-substantial variations of the performance of the Software from
the Documentation do not establish a warranty right. This warranty does
not apply to updates, upgrades, pre-releases, or the Software that has
been altered by you, to the extent such alterations caused a defect. To
make a warranty claim, you must return the Software to the location
where you obtained it along with proof of purchase within the period of
time set forth above.</p>
<p>If the Software does not perform substantially in accordance with the
Documentation, MVTec may, in its sole discretion repair or replace the
Software.</p>
<p>EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. MVTEC HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<p>YOUR STATUTORY WARRANTY RIGHTS SHALL REMAIN UNAFFECTED SUBJECT TO THE
EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>MVTEC'S LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED IN CASE OF INTENT AND GROSS
NEGLIGENCE.</p>
<p>MVTEC IS LIABLE FOR SLIGHT NEGLIGENCE ONLY: (1) FOR DAMAGES RESULTING
FROM INJURY TO LIFE, BODY, OR HEALTH; OR (2) FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
THE BREACH OF A MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION (I.E. AN OBLIGATION,
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
UPON WHICH YOU HAVE REASONABLY RELIED ON); IN SUCH CASE, HOWEVER,
LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FORESEEABLE, TYPICALLY
OCCURRING DAMAGE.</p>
<p>THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY IF MVTEC
FRAUDULENTLY CONCEALS A DEFECT OR IF MVTEC HAS ACCEPTED A GUARANTEE FOR
THE QUALITY OF THE SOFTWARE. THE SAME APPLIES TO YOUR CLAIMS UNDER THE
GERMAN PRODUCT LIABILITY ACT.</p>
<p>FURTHER LIABILITY OF MVTEC IS EXCLUDED.</p>
<h2 id="hazardous-uses">7. Hazardous Uses</h2>
<p>The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured
or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air
traffic control, direct life support machines, weapons systems, or
similar in which the failure of the Software could lead directly to
death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage
(High-Risk Uses). MVTec and its suppliers specifically disclaim any
express or implied warranty of fitness for High-Risk Uses.</p>
<h2 id="export-compliance">8. Export Compliance</h2>
<p>MVTec’s obligation to fulfill this Agreement is subject to the
provision that the fulfillment is not prevented by any impediments
arising out of applicable national or international foreign trade and
customs requirements or embargoes or other sanctions. You agree to
comply fully with all applicable national and international export and
re-export control regulations including, but not limited to, those of
the Federal Republic of Germany, of the European Union, of the United
States of America and regulations of any other country or jurisdiction
which may apply (Export Regulations). In particular, but not in
limitation of the foregoing, you must assure that the Software and any
derivatives thereof are not: (i) downloaded, exported, re-exported or
transferred, directly or indirectly, contrary to any applicable economic
sanction or Export Regulations, or (ii) used for any purpose prohibited
by the Export Regulations or (iii) delivered to persons/entities
otherwise ineligible to acquire, license or use the Software.</p>
<p>MVTec reserves the right to conduct any necessary review of Export
Regulations, and, upon request, you shall promptly provide MVTec with
the necessary information to fulfill its legal obligations. You shall
indemnify and</p>
<p>hold harmless MVTec from and against any claim, proceeding, action,
fine, loss, cost and damages arising out of or relating to your
noncompliance with export control regulations, and you shall compensate
MVTec for all losses and expenses resulting therefrom. This Section will
survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any
reason.</p>
<h2 id="entire-agreementseverability">9. Entire
Agreement/Severability</h2>
<p>This Agreement contains the entire, final, and exclusive
understanding between MVTec and you, and may not be modified or amended
except by written instrument, executed by authorized representatives of
MVTec and you. If any provisions of this Agreement are held to be
illegal, invalid, or enforceable for any reason, the remainder of the
provisions of this license will remain in full force and effect and you
and MVTec will agree on the replacement of the invalid contractual
provision by an appropriate provision which comes as close as possible
to what you and MVTec would have wanted, had they considered the
point.</p>
<h2 id="applicable-law">10. Applicable Law</h2>
<p>This Software License Agreement is governed by the laws of Germany.
The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods shall not apply. All of the disputes arising from this
Software License Agreement and in association with it will be resolved
exclusively by the courts of Munich.</p>

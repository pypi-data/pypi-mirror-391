# Quality Bar — Determinism

Checks

- When determinism promised: seeds, model/version, aspect, chain recorded sufficient to reproduce.
- Plan-only items marked deferred with constraints reviewed.
- State propagation on converge: the next scene’s first paragraph reflects the entering state (not
  necessarily a literal echo), and at least one option is conditioned by state.

Evidence

- Parameter logs per asset; noting provider specifics.
- First-paragraph reflection and a state-aware affordance identified, player-safe.

Common Failures

- Missing seeds/versions; plan contradicts style; inconsistent parameters across set.
- Converged branches with no perceivable state echo at the next opening beat.

Remediation

- Regenerate with logging; adjust constraints with Style Lead; document non-deterministic
  exceptions.
- Add reflection in the opening paragraph and condition one affordance by state when branches
  converge.

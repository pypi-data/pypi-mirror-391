# Intent Handler — scene.write

Inputs

- TU brief (scope, beats), style guide/register_map, canon references.

Preconditions

- TU open; style constraints known; any required canon decisions recorded.

Process

1. Outline beats and intended choices; map gateway phrasing.
2. Draft prose to register; integrate canon sparingly on player surfaces.
3. Ensure choices clear/contrastive; avoid meta language.
4. Self-check style (tone, diction, motifs); fix issues.
5. Emit `tu.checkpoint` summarizing progress; attach `edit_notes` if proposing manuscript edits.

Outputs

- Draft scene text (Hot out-of-band); `tu.checkpoint`; optional `edit_notes` payload.

# Quality Bar — Presentation

Checks

- Manuscript/codex/PN contain zero spoilers or internal labels.
- In-world language only; no technique talk on player surfaces.
- Diegetic bridge on jumps: include a one-line transit when moving between anchors to avoid
  “teleporting.”

Evidence

- Quote offending lines and suggested safe rewrites.
- The bridge line or equivalent paraphrase demonstrating in-world movement.

Common Failures

- Spoilers in codex; PN leaks codewords/state; internal labels visible; meta choices.
- Abrupt jumps between locations without transit.

Remediation

- Move spoilers into canon notes; rephrase PN lines diegetically; rename internals; rewrite choices.
- Add a one-line diegetic bridge on anchor jumps.

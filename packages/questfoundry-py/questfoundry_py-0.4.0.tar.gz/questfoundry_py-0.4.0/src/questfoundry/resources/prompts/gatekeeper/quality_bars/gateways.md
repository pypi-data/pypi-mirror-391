# Quality Bar — Gateways

Checks

- Single, clear condition phrased in-world; PN can enforce without leaks.
- Negative/positive conditions consistent across sections.

Evidence

- Show PN lines enforcing the gateway diegetically.

Common Failures

- Ambiguous conditions; hidden unwinnable states; PN leaks codewords/state.

Remediation

- Rewrite condition and PN phrasing; add catch-up or fail-forward beats.

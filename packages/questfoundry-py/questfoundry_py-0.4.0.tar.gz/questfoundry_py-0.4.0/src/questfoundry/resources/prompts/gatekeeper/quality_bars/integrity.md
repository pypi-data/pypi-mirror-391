# Quality Bar — Integrity

Checks

- All links/section refs resolve; no unintended dead ends.
- Terminals are explicitly labeled and intentional.

Evidence

- List unresolved refs with file:path or section id.

Common Failures

- Dangling links; forgotten returns; mismatched anchors.

Remediation

- Create missing targets or retarget; add return paths; mark terminals explicitly.

# Quality Bar — Nonlinearity

Checks

- Planned hubs/loops/gateways exist and change outcomes on revisit.
- Anti-funneling (first choice): first-scene choices are not functionally equivalent (avoid same
  destination and same opening experience). If convergence is needed, the next scene’s first
  paragraph must reflect the chosen path (lexical, behavioral, or situational).

Evidence

- Diagram or enumerate branches and return-with-difference examples.
- Quote/paraphrase first paragraph reflection when branches converge; point to the diegetic bridge
  line on the jump.

Common Failures

- Cosmetic loops; thin hubs; no meaningful change on revisit.
- Early funnel without immediate reflection (fake agency).

Remediation

- Add state effects; diversify outcomes; merge trivial hubs.
- Insert a micro-beat between scenes to set a visible state flag; ensure the next scene opens with a
  reflection of that state and conditions at least one affordance by state.

# Intent Handler — topology.design

Inputs

- Current sections map, planned beats, canon/style constraints.

Preconditions

- TU open; upstream canon implications reviewed.

Process

1. Sketch hubs/loops; define branches and terminals; annotate return-with-difference.
2. For each keystone, enumerate at least one viable path (sections/choices).
3. Identify gateway needs; note single clear conditions and obtainability routes.
4. Check for cosmetic loops or thin hubs; adjust to meaningful outcomes.
5. Emit `tu.checkpoint` summarizing topology and risks; propose hooks for expansions.

Outputs

- Updated topology notes (Hot); `tu.checkpoint`; suggested next loop and handoffs.

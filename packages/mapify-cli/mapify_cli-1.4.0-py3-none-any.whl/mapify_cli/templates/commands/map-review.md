description: Comprehensive MAP review of changes

**🚨 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN 🚨**

You are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from:

❌ **"Optimizing" the workflow due to token limits** - Token constraints are NOT a valid reason to skip agents
❌ **"Combining steps to save time"** - Each agent MUST be called individually
❌ **"Doing Reflector/Curator work manually"** - This breaks cipher integration
❌ **"Creating a comprehensive document instead"** - This is NOT the MAP workflow
❌ **"Skipping reflection for simple tasks"** - EVERY subtask requires Reflector + Curator
❌ **Any variation of "I'll optimize by..."** - NO OPTIMIZATION ALLOWED

**IF YOU VIOLATE THESE RULES:**
- cipher_memory_search won't be called → duplicate knowledge
- cipher_extract_and_operate_memory won't be called → knowledge won't be shared
- The ENTIRE PURPOSE of MAP Framework will be defeated

**YOU MUST:**
✅ Call EVERY agent in sequence for EVERY subtask
✅ Verify each agent used required MCP tools (check output)
✅ Complete the FULL workflow even if it takes 100K+ tokens
✅ Ask user to continue if you hit token limit, but NEVER skip agents

Use monitor, predictor, and evaluator agents to review current changes.

Provide detailed analysis of code quality, potential impacts, and quality scores.

## Step 1: Query Playbook for Review Patterns

```bash
# Get review best practices
REVIEW_PATTERNS=$(mapify playbook query "code review [language]" --limit 5 --section CODE_QUALITY_RULES --section SECURITY_PATTERNS)
```

# mkdocs_fedi_comment

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin requires a [comments-server](https://bovine.codeberg.page/comments/)
> to work.

This plugin is meant to enable commenting from the Fediverse
on sites build with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). This plugin
uses the overrides provided by [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
This means that a simplest configuration would look like

```yml
theme:
  name: material

plugins:
  - fedi-comments:
      base_path: https://comments.bovine.social/
      actor:
        name: mkdocs-fedi-comments
        handle: mkdocs_fedi_comments
  - search
```

The `fedi-comments` plugin provided by this package requires
some configuration. `base_path` is where your comments server is located. This is
used to determine the location of the ActivityPub objects via
`{base_path}/pages/{encoded_url}` and for the API endpoint to
retrieve comments from, i.e. `{base_path}/comments/{encoded_url}`.

Second the values under `actor` are used to create the used ActivityPub
actor. In addition to `name` and `handle`, which are required,
one currently can also specify `summary` and `icon`.

## The sample site

The sample site is deployed to [https://bovine.codeberg.page/mkdocs_fedi_comments/](https://bovine.codeberg.page/mkdocs_fedi_comments/) and the corresponding installation
of comments is configured with

```toml
[[pages]]
url = "https://bovine.codeberg.page/mkdocs_fedi_comments"
name = "mkdocs_fedi_comments"
```

## Development

There are some python tests that can be run via

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Similarly one can check that the sample_site builds via

```bash
cd sample_site
uv run mkdocs build
```

This executes the plugin, which is included in the sample site
as an editable dependency.

### JavaScript component

The replies are displayed through a JavaScript component. It
is automatically build with the python package. One can manually run
this step via

```bash
uv run hatch build --hooks-only --target wheel
```

### Development

First enter the `js` directory.

To visually develop the component run, you have to first
generate the [MSW service worker](https://storybook.js.org/addons/msw-storybook-addon)
and the [MSW Docs](https://mswjs.io/docs/best-practices/managing-the-worker#generating-the-worker-script).

```bash
npx msw init public/ --save
```

then you can run storybook via

```bash
npm run storybook
```

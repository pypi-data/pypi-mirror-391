# Fediverse Pasture

This python package contains tools to test Fediverse applications. This
package uses [bovine](https://bovine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a lot
of the Fediverse related logic. It should also be noted that the aim here
is to debug issues caused by federation, thus everything involves starting
a webserver and running requests against it.

## Usage

For usage information, see the [documentation](https://funfedi.dev/python_package/).

### With docker container

One can start the one actor server via

```bash
docker run --rm --name pasture\
    --hostname pasture-one-actor --network fediverse-pasture\
    helgekr/pasture one_actor
```

and then use the send tool via

```bash
docker exec pasture ./send acct:user@domain
```

Afterwards you should stop the container with `docker stop pasture`.

## Development

Install the necessary dependencies via

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

To lint and check code formatting run

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

To test the code run

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### With docker

To start the local environment in docker run

```bash
docker run --detach --rm --name pasture-dev\
    --hostname pasture-one-actor\
    --network fediverse-pasture\
    -v .:/data --workdir /data\
    -e UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmp/venv\
    ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-alpine\
    uv run python -mfediverse_pasture.one_actor --port 80
```

and then

```bash
docker exec -ti -e UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmp/venv pasture-dev \
    uv run python -mfediverse_pasture.send acct:user@domain

```

to send a message.

## Releasing

Releasing is done automatically on merge to the main branch.
For this to happen, the following has to be true

- There exists a milestone with the version number
- All issues in the milestone are closed
- There exists an entry in CHANGES.md
- The package version has the same version number

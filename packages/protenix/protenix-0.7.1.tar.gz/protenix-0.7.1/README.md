We’re excited to introduce **Protenix** — a trainable, open-source PyTorch reproduction of [AlphaFold 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w).

Protenix is built for high-accuracy structure prediction. It serves as an initial step in our journey toward advancing accessible and extensible research tools for the computational biology community.

## 🌟 Related Projects
- **[PXDesign](https://protenix.github.io/pxdesign/)** is a model suite for de novo protein-binder design built on the Protenix foundation model. PXDesign achieves 20–73% experimental success rates across multiple targets — 2–6× higher than prior SOTA methods such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. The framework is freely accessible via the Protenix Server.

- **[PXMeter](https://github.com/bytedance/PXMeter/)** is an open-source toolkit designed for reproducible evaluation of structure prediction models, released with high-quality benchmark dataset that has been manually reviewed to remove experimental artifacts and non-biological interactions. The associated study presents an in-depth comparative analysis of state-of-the-art models, drawing insights from extensive metric data and detailed case studies. The evaluation of Protenix is based on PXMeter.
- **[Protenix-Dock](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix-Dock)**: Our implementation of a classical protein-ligand docking framework that leverages empirical scoring functions. Without using deep neural networks, Protenix-Dock delivers competitive performance in rigid docking tasks.

### 📊 Benchmark
We benchmarked the performance of Protenix-v0.5.0 against [Boltz-1](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/releases/tag/v0.4.1) and [Chai-1](https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab/releases/tag/v0.6.1) across multiple datasets, including [PoseBusters v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05777), [AF3 Nucleic Acid Complexes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w), [AF3 Antibody Set](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/20ad0a21eb49febcaad4a6f5d71aa6b701512e5b/docs/metadata_antibody_antigen.csv), and our curated Recent PDB set.

Protenix-v0.5.0 was trained using a PDB cut-off date of September 30, 2021. For the comparative analysis, we adhered to AF3’s inference protocol, generating 25 predictions by employing 5 model seeds, with each seed yielding 5 diffusion samples. The predictions were subsequently ranked based on their respective ranking scores.

We will soon release the benchmarking toolkit, including the evaluation datasets, data curation pipeline, and metric calculators, to support transparent and reproducible benchmarking.


## 🛠 Installation

### PyPI

```bash
pip3 install protenix
```

For development on a CPU-only machine, it is convenient to install with the `--cpu` flag in editable mode:
```
python3 setup.py develop --cpu
```

### Docker (Recommended for Training)

Check the detailed guide: [<u> Docker Installation</u>](docs/docker_installation.md).


## 🚀 Inference

### Expected Input & Output Format
For details on the input JSON format and expected outputs, please refer to the [Input/Output Documentation](docs/infer_json_format.md).


### Prepare Inputs

#### Convert PDB/CIF File to Input JSON

If your input is a `.pdb` or `.cif` file, you can convert it into a JSON file for inference.


```bash
# ensure `release_data/ccd_cache/components.cif` or run:
python scripts/gen_ccd_cache.py -c release_data/ccd_cache/ -n [num_cpu]

# for PDB
# download pdb file
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/7pzb.pdb
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.pdb --out_dir ./output

# for CIF (same process)
# download cif file
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/7pzb.cif
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.cif --out_dir ./output
```


#### (Optional) Prepare MSA Files

We provide an independent MSA search utility. You can run it using either a JSON file or a protein FASTA file.
```bash
# run msa search with json file, it will write precomputed msa dir info to a new json file.
protenix msa --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output

# run msa search with fasta file which only contains protein.
protenix msa --input examples/prot.fasta --out_dir ./output

# use colabfold-like server
export MMSEQS_SERVICE_HOST_URL=https://api.colabfold.com # or other in-house host url
protenix msa --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output --msa_server_mode colabfold
```

### Inference via Command Line

If you installed `Protenix` via `pip`, you can run the following command to perform model inference:


```bash
# 1. The default model_name is protenix_base_default_v0.5.0, you can modify it by passing --model_name xxxx
# 2. We provide recommended default configuration parameters for each model. To customize cycle/step/use_msa settings, you must set --use_default_params false
# 3. You can modify cycle/step/use_msa by passing --cycle x1 --step x2 --use_msa false

# run with example.json, which contains precomputed msa dir.
protenix predict --input examples/example.json --out_dir  ./output --seeds 101 --model_name "protenix_base_default_v0.5.0"

# run with example.json, we use only esm feature.
protenix predict --input examples/example.json --out_dir  ./output --seeds 101 --model_name "protenix_mini_esm_v0.5.0" --use_msa false

# run with multiple json files, the default seed is 101.
protenix predict --input ./jsons_dir/ --out_dir  ./output

# if the json do not contain precomputed msa dir,
# add --use_msa (default: true) to search msa and then predict.
# if mutiple seeds are provided, split them by comma.
protenix predict --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output --seeds 101,102 --use_msa true
```

### Inference via Bash Script
Alternatively you can run inference by:
Alternatively, run inference via script:

```bash
bash inference_demo.sh
```

The script accepts the following arguments:
* `model_name`: Name of the model to use for inference.
* `input_json_path`: Path to a JSON file that fully specifies the input structure.
* `dump_dir`: Directory where inference results will be saved.
* `dtype`: Data type used during inference. Supported options: `bf16` and `fp32`.
* `use_msa`: Whether to enable MSA features (default: true).


> **Note**: By default, layernorm and EvoformerAttention kernels are disabled for simplicity.
> To enable them and speed up inference, see the [**Kernels Setup Guide**](docs/kernels.md).


## 🧬 Training

Refer to the [Training Documentation](docs/training.md) for setup and details.

## Model Features
###  📌 Constraint

Protenix supports specifying ***contacts*** (at both residue and atom levels) and ***pocket constraints*** as extra guidance. Our benchmark results demonstrate that constraint-guided predictions are significantly more accurate.See our [doc](docs/infer_json_format.md#constraint) for input format details.

![Constraint Metrics](assets/constraint_metrics.png)

###  📌 Mini-Models
We introduce Protenix-Mini, a lightweight variant of Protenix that uses reduced network blocks and few ODE steps (even as few as one or two steps) to enable efficient prediction of biomolecular complex structures. Experimental results show that Protenix-Mini achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and accuracy, with only a marginal 1–5% drop in evaluation metrics such as interface LDDT, complex LDDT, and ligand RMSD success rate. Protenix-Mini enables accurate structure prediction in high-throughput and resource-limited scenarios, making it well-suited for practical applications at scale. The following comparisons were performed on a subset of the RecentPDB dataset comprising sequences with fewer than 768 tokens.

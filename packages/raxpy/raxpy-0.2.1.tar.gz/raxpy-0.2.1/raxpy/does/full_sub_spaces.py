    Allocations n_points to sub-spaces given the computed sub-spaces

    If not provided, target portions are computed from the null-portion
    attributes of the dimensions in each sub-space. For example,
    if x1, x2 are in a subspace and the null_portions are 0.5 for each,
    then this sub-space is allocated 0.25 of the n_points.

    Arguments
    ---------
    space:InputSpace
        the whole design space

    n_points: int

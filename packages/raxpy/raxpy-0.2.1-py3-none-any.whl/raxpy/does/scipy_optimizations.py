    """Centered discrepancy after an elementary perturbation of a LHS.

    An elementary perturbation consists of an exchange of coordinates between
    two points: ``sample[i1, k] <-> sample[i2, k]``. By construction,
    this operation conserves the LHS properties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : array_like (n, d)
        The sample (before permutation) to compute the discrepancy from.
    i1 : int
        The first line of the elementary permutation.
    i2 : int
        The second line of the elementary permutation.
    k : int
        The column of the elementary permutation.
    disc : float
        Centered discrepancy of the design before permutation.

    Returns
    -------
    discrepancy : float
        Centered discrepancy of the design after permutation.

    Return random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive), or if
    endpoint=True, low (inclusive) to high (inclusive). Replaces
    `RandomState.randint` (with endpoint=False) and
    `RandomState.random_integers` (with endpoint=True).

    Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of the
    specified dtype. If high is None (the default), then results are from
    0 to low.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gen : {None, np.random.RandomState, np.random.Generator}
        Random number generator. If None, then the np.random.RandomState
        singleton is used.
    low : int or array-like of ints
        Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn from the distribution (unless
        high=None, in which case this parameter is 0 and this value is used
        for high).
    high : int or array-like of ints
        If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from
        the distribution (see above for behavior if high=None). If array-like,
        must contain integer values.
    size : array-like of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., (m, n, k), then m * n * k
        samples are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is
        returned.
    dtype : {str, dtype}, optional
        Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their name,
        i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available and a specific
        precision may have different C types depending on the platform.
        The default value is 'int64'.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, sample from the interval [low, high] instead of the default
        [low, high) Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    out: int or ndarray of ints
        size-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate distribution,

[prep CDF-25332] ✅ Move read chunks into Uploadable interface (#2184)

# Description

This PR moves the `read_chunks` into the `UploadableStorageIO`
interface. By doing this we no longer need to have the exception for
AssetIO and can instead handle it directly in the IO class. I do this as
the upcoming `DataPointsIO` will need a similar exception, thus I think
it should be built into the interface and treated as part of the upload
pattern, rather than two exceptions.

Note that this solution gives the `IO` class control over the chunking,
which is very useful for assets, as then each level in the hierarchy can
be in different chunks. Today, they will be mixed.

## Changelog

- [ ] Skip

### Improved

upload. It now separates each level in the hierarchy by request.

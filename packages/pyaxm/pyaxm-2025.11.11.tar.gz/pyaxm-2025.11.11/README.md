The purpose of this repo is to create a python library to easily get information using the Apple Business Manager API using Python.

A CLI command is also included, `pyacm-cli`.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applebusinessmanagerapi

## Setup
If you want to setup the authentication using envvars, do the following:

You will need to setup 2 environmental variables that are provided
when creating the private key in ABM:

`AXM_CLIENT_ID` and `AXM_KEY_ID`

Place the private key in your home directory inside the `.config/pyaxm` folder
and rename it `key.pem`

This location will be used to store a cached access_token that can be reused
until it expires. While testing I have experienced that requesting too many
access tokens will result in a response with status code 400 when 
trying to get a new token.

Otherwise you will have to pass the client id, key id and private key as arguments
to the client like so:

```python
from pyaxm.client import Client

axm_client = Client(
    axm_client_id="CLIENT_ID",
    axm_key_id="KEY_ID",
    key_path="PRIVATE_KEY",
    token_path="TOKEN_PATH"
)
```
The token path is the location where the access token will be stored.

## Installation:
`pip install pyaxm`

## CLI:
Usage: pyaxm-cli COMMAND [ARGS]

### Commands
`devices` -> List all devices in the organization.

`device` -> Get a device by ID.

`mdm-servers` -> List all MDM servers.

`mdm-server` -> List devices in a specific MDM server.

`mdm-server-assigned` -> Get the server assignment for a device.

`assign-device` -> Assign a device to an MDM server.

`unassign-device` -> Unassign a device from an MDM server.

`apple-care-coverage` -> Get AppleCare warranty coverage information for a device.
The data returned is on CSV format so you can store it as a CSV if needed

# Client:
Example usage:
```python
from pyaxm.client import Client

axm_client = Client()

devices = axm_client.list_devices()
print(devices)

device = axm_client.get_device(device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER')
print(device)

mdm_servers = axm_client.list_mdm_servers()
print(mdm_servers)

# The MDM server ID can be extracted from listing all mdm servers
mdm_server = axm_client.list_devices_in_mdm_server(server_id="MDM_SERVER_ID")
print(mdm_server)

device_assigned_server = axm_client.list_devices_in_mdm_server(device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER')
print(device_assigned_server)

assignment_result = axm_client.assign_unassign_device_to_mdm_server(
    device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER',
    server_id="MDM_SERVER_ID",
    action="ASSIGN_DEVICES"|"UNASSIGN_DEVICES"
)

apple_care_coverage = axm_client.get_apple_care_coverage(device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER')
print(apple_care_coverage)
```

## Issues:
* need to add tests
* unassign, assign devices need to be able to pass more than 1 device

This is still a work in progress

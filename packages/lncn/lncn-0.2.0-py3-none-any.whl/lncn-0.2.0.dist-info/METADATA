# lncn

Lncn is a simple python CLI that counts the SLOC (source lines of code) in a file or directory.

To install, simply run `pip install lncn`. Make sure the `Scripts/` directory in your python installation is on the PATH.

If you want to count the lines within a project, just specify the directory as an absolute path. If you located within the directory, use '.'.

Common non-source files (documentation, metadata, configurations, build artifacts, assets, data, etc.) are ignored by default, but specific paths to ignore beyond this can be specified with the `-i` / `--ignore` flag. To disable this, and include everything by default, use the `-k` / `--keep-all` flag.

When specifying paths to ignore, '*' can be used to signify some arbitrary text, similar to the syntax of a gitignore file. For example, to ignore all python and all shell files in a directory, you could put `--ignore *.py *.sh`. Note that this does not work with more complex gitignore syntax.

# NRC-ILT fork: ilt-editdistance

This fork of editdistance aims to support the needs of the National Research Council Canada's Indigenous Language Technologies (NRC ILT) projects, applying minimal patches to `editdistance` for our projects to work on all OSes and Python versions we support.

Our fork can be installed via `pip install ilt-editdistance` but it is a drop-in replacement the regular `editdistance` package.

You should continue to cite and give credit to the original author if you use our fork.

The only change we plan to make is to keep publishing new patch increments with pre-built wheels as new versions of Python are published.

# editdistance

Fast implementation of the edit distance (Levenshtein distance).

This library simply implements [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) with C++ and Cython.

The algorithm used in this library is proposed by
[Heikki Hyyrö, "Explaining and extending the bit-parallel approximate string matching algorithm of Myers", (2001)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.19.7158&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

## Binary wheels

Thanks to [pypa/cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel)
There are binary wheels on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

## Install

You can install via pip:

```bash
pip install editdistance
```


## Usage

It's quite simple:

```python
import editdistance
editdistance.eval('banana', 'bahama')
# 2L
```


# Simple Benchmark

With IPython, I tried several libraries:

* [pyxDamerauLevenshtein](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyxDamerauLevenshtein)
* [pylev](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylev)
* [python-Levenshtein](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein)

On Python 2.7.5:

```python
a = 'fsffvfdsbbdfvvdavavavavavava'
b = 'fvdaabavvvvvadvdvavavadfsfsdafvvav'
import pylev
timeit pylev.levenshtein(a, b)
# 100 loops, best of 3: 7.48 ms per loop

from pyxdameraulevenshtein import damerau_levenshtein_distance
timeit damerau_levenshtein_distance(a, b)
# 100000 loops, best of 3: 11.4 µs per loop

timeit editdistance.eval(a, b)  # my library
# 100000 loops, best of 3: 3.5 µs per loop

import Levenshtein

timeit Levenshtein.distance(a, b)
# 100000 loops, best of 3: 3.21 µs per loop
```

## Distance with Any Object

Above libraries only support strings.
But Sometimes other type of objects such as list of strings(words).
I support any iterable, only requires hashable object of it:

```python
Levenshtein.distance(['spam', 'egg'], ['spam', 'ham'])
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
# <ipython-input-22-3e0b30d145ac> in <module>()
# ----> 1 Levenshtein.distance(['spam', 'egg'], ['spam', 'ham'])
#
# TypeError: distance expected two Strings or two Unicodes

editdistance.eval(['spam', 'egg'], ['spam', 'ham'])
# 1L
```

So if object's hash is same, it's same.
You can provide `__hash__` method to your object instances.

Enjoy!

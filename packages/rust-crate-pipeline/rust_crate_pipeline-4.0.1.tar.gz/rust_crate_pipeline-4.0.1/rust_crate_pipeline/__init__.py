# rust_crate_pipeline/__init__.py
"""
Rust Crate Data Processing Pipeline

A comprehensive system for gathering, enriching, and analyzing metadata for Rust crates.
Includes AI-powered enrichment using local LLMs and dependency analysis.

Example usage:
    from rust_crate_pipeline import (
    CrateDataPipeline
)
    from rust_crate_pipeline.main import main

    # Run the main pipeline
    main()

    # Or use the pipeline class directly
    config = PipelineConfig()
    pipeline = CrateDataPipeline(config)
    pipeline.run()

Components:
    - CrateDataPipeline: Main orchestration class
    - PipelineConfig: Configuration management
    - Various analyzers for AI, security, and dependency analysis

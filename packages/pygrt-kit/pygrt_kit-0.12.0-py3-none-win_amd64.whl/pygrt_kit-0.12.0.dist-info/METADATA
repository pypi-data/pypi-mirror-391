# Overview
**[PyGRT](https://github.com/Dengda98/PyGRT): An Efficient and Integrated C/Python Package for Computing Synthetic Seismograms, Strain, Rotation and Stress Tensor in a Layered Half-Space Model (Dynamic & Static Cases)**

 + **PyGRT** now can compute following properties in **both dynamic and static case.**  
    ✔️ **Displacements and its spatial derivatives**  
    ✔️ **Strain Tensor**  
    ✔️ **Rotation Tensor**  
    ✔️ **Stress Tensor**


 + **At present, PyGRT can run on**  
    ✔️ **Linux**  
    ✔️ **MacOS**  
    ✔️ **Windows**

 + **PyGRT is extremely easy to install** by distributing pre-built binary files.

 + **PyGRT now supports the model with liquid layers.**

 + **PyGRT is still evolving**, and more features will be released in the future.

 + **Surface wave** modules will be released soon.

# Features

- **Dual-Language**:  
  To optimize performance, **PyGRT** uses **C** for its core computational tasks, while **Python** provides a user-friendly interface. Support **script style** and **command line style** to run the program.

- **Parallelization**:  
  Accelerated with **OpenMP** for parallel processing.

- **Integration**:  
  Built on the **Generalized Reflection-Transmission matrix Method (GRTM)** and the **Discrete Wavenumber Method (DWM)**, **PyGRT** integrates the **Peak-Trough Averaging Method (PTAM)**, **Filon’s Integration Method (FIM)** and **Self-Adaptive Filon’s Integration Method (SAFIM)** to handle diverse source-receiver distributions. 

- **Modular Design**:   
  Clean and organized code structure, making it easy to extend and maintain.

- **Compatibility**:  
  **PyGRT provides pre-built static files**, ensuring ease of installation, usage, and portability across different systems.

# Pre-Requisite

+ For Thread-Level Parallel Computing
  - [**OpenMP**](https://www.openmp.org/)
    - For Linux and macOS users: If the GNU compiler is installed on your system, the `OpenMP` library is usually included.  
    - For Windows users: `OpenMP` has been statically linked.  

    **In general, you don't have to worry about it**. However, if the program complains that "`libgomp.so` not found" or "needs more dependencies", you should install `OpenMP`.
    
<br>

+ For Python Script Style  
  - [**Anaconda**](https://anaconda.org) (*recommend*), to build your virtual environment.
  - Other dependencies are declared in `setup.py`, automatically handled by `pip install`.
    
<br>

+ For Command Line Style  
  the output waveforms are binary files in SAC format, you need [**Seismic Analysis Code (SAC)**](http://www.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/sac/) to view and process.
    



# Installation
In **PyGRT**, the C programs and libraries operate independently of Python (not CPython or Cython). If you are not familiar with Python and pip, and prefer the Command Line Style, you can quickly run the program by downloading the latest [**GitHub release**](https://github.com/Dengda98/PyGRT/releases) for your machine. The necessary files are located in the `pygrt/C_extension/bin` and `pygrt/C_extension/lib` folders.

------

Two ways, choose one:
 
1. **PYPI** (recommend)  
  Run the following command in your virtual environment:
    ```Bash
    pip install -v pygrt-kit
    ```


2. [**Github release**](https://github.com/Dengda98/PyGRT/releases)

   - Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Dengda98/PyGRT/releases) for your machine, uncompress, and change the directory.

   - Run the following command in your virtual environment:

      ```bash
      pip install -v .
      ```

3. *Build from Source Code.   
   See [**中文文档**](https://pygrt.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/)  |  [**English Document**](https://pygrt.readthedocs.io/en/)  

# Setting

For Command Line Style, run
```bash
python -m pygrt.print
```
the outputs are
```
PyGRT installation directory: </path/to/installation>
PyGRT executable file directory: </path/to/installation/bin>
PyGRT library directory: </path/to/installation/lib>
```
and you can 
+ add "executable file directory" to `PATH` environment variable.

Then you can run the command like `grt` in terminal.   
**For each command, use `-h` to see the help message.**

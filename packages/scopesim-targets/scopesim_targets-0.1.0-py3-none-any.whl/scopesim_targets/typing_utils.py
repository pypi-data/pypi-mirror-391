"""Custom composite types used in this package.

Currently contains `POSITION_TYPE`, `SPECTRUM_TYPE` and `BRIGHTNESS_TYPE`,
neither of which is final. These are kept here so that Target subclasses can
simply import and use them, and when we eventually refine them, the code doesn't
need to be updated everywhere.

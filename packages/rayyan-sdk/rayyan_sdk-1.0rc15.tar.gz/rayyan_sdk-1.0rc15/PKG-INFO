Description: # Rayyan Python SDK
        
        A Python SDK for [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/), the popular systematic reviews platform.
        It is a wrapper around the [HTTP APIs](https://github.com/rayyansys/rayyan-api-docs) of Rayyan.
        ## Installation
        
        To install the latest stable release of Rayyan Python SDK, execute the following command:
        
        ```shell
        pip install rayyan-sdk
        ```
        
        For the nightly builds, execute the following command:
        
        ```shell
        pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rayyan-sdk
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use the SDK, you need to have a credentials file in JSON format like the one below.
        You can retrieve such file by signing in to your Rayyan account
        (create a free account if you don't have one) and visiting My Account page.
        
        ```json
        // creds.json
        {
            "access_token": "9c2b0fe74ab7cd8d1227cd2fd",
            "refresh_token": "b40e325a1a7f53831ec3c09fffc7"
        }
        ```
        
        Import Rayyan main class and pass the credentials file to it like this:
        
        ```python
        rayyan = Rayyan("cred.json")
        ```
        
        > Note: The credentials file should be kept secret and not shared with anyone.
        It acts as a password to your Rayyan account.
        
        To get the authenticated user info:
        
        ```python
        user = rayyan.user.get_info()
        ```

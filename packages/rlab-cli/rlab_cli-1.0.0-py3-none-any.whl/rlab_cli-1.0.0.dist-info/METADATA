# RLab CLI

A comprehensive command-line interface for the RLab Platform, providing digital twin capabilities for educational robotics powered by the Nueroid framework.

## Features

- **Digital Twin Framework**: Complete Model/Shadow/Twin architecture using abstract factory pattern
- **Educational Robotics**: Specialized for robotics learning and research environments
- **Multi-User Support**: Role-based access for students, professors, administrators, and industry partners
- **COE Compliance**: Built-in reporting for Center of Excellence requirements
- **Interactive CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for all operations

## Installation

### From PyPI (when published)
```bash
pip install rlab-cli
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rosversity/rlab-cli.git
cd rlab-cli
pip install -e .
```

### Development Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rosversity/rlab-cli.git
cd rlab-cli
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start

After installation, you can start the RLab CLI:

```bash
rlab
# or
rlab-cli
```

This will launch the interactive command-line interface where you can:

1. **Initialize RLab Facility** - Set up your educational facility
2. **User Management** - Register and manage users (students, professors, etc.)
3. **Robotics Lab Management** - Add and manage robotics assets
4. **Digital Twin Operations** - Interact with digital twins
5. **Learning & Research** - Create learning modules and research projects
6. **COE Reports** - Generate compliance reports
7. **System Information** - View system status

## Architecture

RLab CLI is built on the Nueroid Digital Twin Framework using an abstract factory pattern:

- **Model**: Static data, UI widgets, 3D assets, and data tables
- **Shadow**: Workflows, hardware interfaces, and process management  
- **Twin**: Dashboard widgets, user interactions, and real-time data

### Digital Twin Hierarchy

- **Facility**: Educational institution level
- **Product**: Major systems (software/hardware platforms)
- **System**: Functional systems (user management, lab management)
- **Asset**: Individual robotics equipment
- **Component**: Learning modules and components
- **Process**: Executable workflows

## Example Usage

```python
from rlab_cli import RLabPlatform, UserType

# Initialize platform
rlab = RLabPlatform()
facility = rlab.initialize_rlab_facility("My University RLab")

# Register users
rlab.register_user("prof_smith", UserType.PROFESSOR)
rlab.register_user("student_jane", UserType.STUDENT)

# Add robotics assets
vacuum_robot = rlab.add_robotics_asset("Main Lab", "CleanBot 3000", "Cleaning Robot")
vacuum_robot.model.static_data["cost"] = 50000
vacuum_robot.model.static_data["coe_component"] = "ATL Consumables"

# Generate COE report
report = rlab.generate_coe_report()
print(f"Total Allocation: ₹{report['total_allocation']:,}")
```

## User Types

- **School Admin**: Full administrative access
- **Management**: Oversight and reporting capabilities
- **Professor**: Course and research management
- **Student**: Learning and project participation
- **Industry**: Partnership and collaboration features
- **Research Partner**: Research collaboration tools
- **Vendor**: Equipment and service management
- **Developer**: Technical development access

## Digital Twin Types

- **Component**: Individual learning components
- **Asset**: Physical robotics equipment
- **System**: Functional systems and subsystems
- **Product**: Complete product platforms
- **Facility**: Institutional level organization
- **Process**: Executable workflow processes

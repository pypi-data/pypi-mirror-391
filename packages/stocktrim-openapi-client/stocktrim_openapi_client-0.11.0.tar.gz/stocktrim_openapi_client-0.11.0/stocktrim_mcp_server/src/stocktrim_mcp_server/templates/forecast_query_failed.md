# Forecast Data Query Failed

**Error**: {error}

## Troubleshooting

- Verify filters are valid (location codes, supplier codes, categories)
- Check that forecasts have been calculated recently
- Run `forecasts_update_and_monitor` to ensure forecasts are current
- Try querying without filters to see if any data exists

# Introduction
Welcome to the Heterogeneous Catalysis Example upload showcasing some functionalities of the [`nomad-catalysis` plugin](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin).
In this example upload you find a template file for automatic generation of catalyst sample and catalytic reaction entries. The data for the entries is read out from an excel sheet, which you can download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/src/nomad_catalysis/example_uploads/template_example/template_CatalysisCollection.xlsx). Note that the file *ending* `CatalysisCollection.xlsx` can not be changed, for the automatic parsing to work. However, csv files ending `CatalysisCollection.csv` will work the same. If sample entries and measurement entries are generated together, the upload needs to be reprocessed after the upload of the `CatalysisCollection` table. 

Further templates for datasets which generate exclusively Catalyst Sample entries are [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/docs/assets/template_CatalystSampleCollection.xlsx) and a template that only generates Catalytic Reaction entries can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/docs/assets/template_CatalyticReactionCollection.xlsx). For a single Catalytic Reaction entry see this template [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/docs/assets/template_CatalyticReaction.xlsx). More options for properties which can be read in directly from the excel sheet can be found in the [nomad-catalysis plugin documentation](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nomad-catalysis-plugin/) [here](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nomad-catalysis-plugin/how_to/use_this_plugin.html#format-of-the-csv-or-xlsx-data-file).

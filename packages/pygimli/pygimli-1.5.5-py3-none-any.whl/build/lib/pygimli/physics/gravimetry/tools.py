    r"""Return Li&Oldenburg like depth weighting of boundaries or cells.

    To account for inherent ambiguity in potential field methods, a depth
    weighting of the regulariation term is often applied in inversion,
    going back to Li & Oldenburg (1996, eq. 18):

    .. math::
        w(z) = \frac{1}{(z+z_0)^{3/2}}

    Here, we reformulate the original equation in order to make it unitless:

    .. math::
        w(z) = \frac{1}{(z/z_0+1)^p}

    Which is the same as before except a factor that can go into the
    regularization strength. The function describes a decay with depth,
    starting from w(0)=1 and approaching w(z)=0 for z>>z0.
    z is the depth of a boundary or cell below the sensor and is determined by
    its mesh center and the sensor position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z0 : float [25]
        centroid depth (w(z0)=1/2^p)
    height : float
        sensor height to be added to depth
    power : float [1.5]
        exponent
    normalize : bool [False]
        normalize such that the mean weight is 1 (like unweighted)
    cell : bool [True]
        use cell center (for cType=0|2|geostat) instead of boundary (cType=1)

    Returns
    -------
    depth weighting vector for all interior boundaries or all cells

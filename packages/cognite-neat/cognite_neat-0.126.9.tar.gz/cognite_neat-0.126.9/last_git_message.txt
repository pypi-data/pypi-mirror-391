[🐛] Mixpanel Pyodide try 3 (#1410)

# Description

The issue is that pyodide is changing the behavior of the async event
loop, and does not allow you to block while doing a look-up of the
values stored in the local storage.

From the
[docs](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/webloop.html#pyodide.webloop.WebLoop)
on the `Webloop` used by `pyodide`.

>
[run_forever()](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_forever)
and
[run_until_complete()](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_until_complete)
cannot block like a normal event loop would because we only have one
thread so blocking would stall the browser event loop and prevent
anything from ever happening.

This leaves us with the following three options (All my attempts at
calling javascript directly has not created any viable alternatives)

I have implemented `Option1`, but trying to be smart by calling read on
import. That means that the first cell will be executed when the user
call `from cognite.neat._session import NeatSession`. This will not work
if the user imports and initialize the session in the same cell, but I
don't think that is common. And if they do, all that happens is they
will get an extra message about the user metrics we track.

`Option2` is the ideal solution, but that is not possible with Pyodide.

I think `Option3` is completely out of the question as we do not want to
burden the user with having to use `await`. when calling any NeatSession
method.

Leverage read context to properly adjust loc of ModelSyntaxError (#1412)

# Description

Please describe the change you have made.

The location of values in spreadsheet which failed validation
(ModelSyntaxError) was incorrect because humanize_error was not
leveraging read context. In the example shows wrong row numbers:

/>

which after fixing was correctly offseted by header, skipped and empty
rows:

/>

Adjust row number method was updated to correctly produce the above
mentione offset for row.


This a few of several PRs which deal with backward compatibility of soon
to be legacy physical data model spreadsheet templates.

# Dojo OpenEnv

Wrapper for `dojo-sdk-client` to use with OpenEnv, enabling Dojo tasks to be used as OpenEnv-compatible environments for reinforcement learning.

## Overview

`dojo-openenv` provides a bridge between the Dojo RL environment framework and OpenEnv, allowing you to run Dojo tasks through the standard OpenEnv interface. This enables seamless integration of Dojo tasks with OpenEnv-based training pipelines and evaluation frameworks.

## Installation

```bash
uv add dojo-openenv
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install dojo-openenv
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from dojo_openenv import DojoEnvClient, DojoAction
from dojo_sdk_core.types import ClickAction

# Initialize the environment with a task ID and API key
env = DojoEnvClient(
    task_id="2048/get-2048",
    api_key="your-api-key-here"
)

try:
    # Reset the environment
    result = env.reset()

    # Run steps until done
    while not result.done:
        # Create an action (or generate an action via an AI agent)
        action = DojoAction(
            action=ClickAction(x=100, y=100),
            reasoning="Clicking on the game board",
            raw_response="User clicked at coordinates (100, 100)"
        )

        # Step the environment
        result = env.step(action)

        # Access observation and reward
        print(f"Reward: {result.reward}")
        print(f"State: {result.observation.task_response.state}")

finally:
    # Clean up
    env.close()
```

## Key Components

### `DojoEnvClient`

The main environment client that implements the OpenEnv `HTTPEnvClient` specification.

### `DojoAction`

Action wrapper that extends the OpenEnv `Action` base class with:

- `action`: A Dojo core action from `dojo-sdk-core` (e.g., `ClickAction`, `TypeAction`, etc.)
- `reasoning`: String describing the reasoning behind the action
- `raw_response`: Raw response from the agent (for debugging or logging)

### `DojoObservation`

Observation wrapper that extends the OpenEnv `Observation` base class with:

- `task_response`: The current task state from the Dojo client, which includes the task history and a current screenshot of the task environment.

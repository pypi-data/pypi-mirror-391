# CHANTER

#### CHANTER is a simple galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling/fitting code, based on the larger BAGPIPES code, of astronomical literary fame. CHANTER provides the barebones of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS), as well as redshift and dust/IGM attenuation effects, and is written in a simple and digestible format, ideal for learning the theory behind larger spectral fitting software codes.

Currently, I cannot include the SSP/IGM grids in the package due to PyPi size limitations, but this is being appealed.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-11

### Added

#### Resources
- **EndUsers** resource with full CRUD operations:
  - `list(company_id)` - Retrieve all end users with optional company filtering
  - `get(id)` - Fetch single end user by ID
  - `create(enduser)` - Create new end user
  - `update(id, enduser)` - Update existing end user
  - `delete(id)` - Delete end user by ID
- **Conversations** resource with full CRUD operations:
  - `list(company_id)` - Retrieve all conversations with optional company filtering
  - `get(id)` - Fetch single conversation by ID
  - `create(conversation)` - Create new conversation
  - `update(id, conversation)` - Update existing conversation
  - `delete(id)` - Delete conversation by ID
- Pydantic-based `EndUser` model with comprehensive field mapping:
  - Core identity fields (email, name, position, phone)
  - Activity tracking (beats, conversations, last active)
  - NPS data (score, comments, dates)
  - Relationship management (tags, related users)
  - Custom fields support
- Pydantic-based `Conversation` model with comprehensive field mapping:
  - Core content fields (subject, description, snippet)
  - Participant management (users, endusers)
  - Status flags (starred, pinned, archived)
  - Categorization (tags, activity tags)
  - Custom fields support

#### Documentation
- **USAGE.md** - Comprehensive 796-line usage guide with examples:
  - Quick start guides for async and sync usage
  - Detailed examples for all three resources (Companies, EndUsers, Conversations)
  - Error handling patterns and best practices
  - Advanced examples (bulk operations, relationship management)
  - Model extensibility patterns (subclassing, custom fields, hybrid approach)
- Updated README.md with:
  - Current feature list and resources overview
  - Enhanced quick start with practical examples
  - Updated roadmap showing Phases 0, 1, 2 complete

#### Model Extensibility
- Full support for model subclassing with custom typed fields
- Three documented extensibility patterns:
  1. Subclassing with additional typed fields (recommended)
  2. Using Planhat's custom object for dynamic fields
  3. Hybrid approach combining both patterns
- Type-safe custom fields with IDE autocomplete support
- Runtime validation via Pydantic for custom fields

#### Public API
- Models now exported from main `__init__.py` for convenient imports:
  - `from pyplanhat import Company, EndUser, Conversation`
- All resources wired to both AsyncPyPlanhat and PyPlanhat clients

### Fixed
- Sync test fixtures now correctly use `@pytest.fixture` instead of `@pytest_asyncio.fixture`
- USAGE.md examples properly handle None list fields before appending
- Model docstrings clarified to distinguish API requirements from Pydantic validation

### Changed
- Test coverage increased from 90% to 97%
- Test suite expanded from 52 to 132 tests (66 async + 66 sync)
- Version bumped to 0.2.0 across all configuration files

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ 132 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ 97% code coverage maintained
- ✅ Zero linting issues (ruff)
- ✅ Zero type errors (mypy)
- ✅ CI passing on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

*Note: Version 0.2.0 completes the v1.0 resource scope with all planned resources (Companies, EndUsers, Conversations) fully implemented, tested, and documented.*

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added

#### Core SDK
- **AsyncPyPlanhat** client with async-first architecture
- **PyPlanhat** synchronous client (auto-generated from async source)
- Context manager support for both clients (`async with` / `with`)
- Bearer token authentication via `api_key` parameter
- Configurable base URL for API endpoint customization

#### Resources
- **Companies** resource with full CRUD operations:
  - `list()` - Retrieve all companies with pagination support
  - `get(id)` - Fetch single company by ID
  - `create(company)` - Create new company
  - `update(id, company)` - Update existing company
  - `delete(id)` - Delete company by ID
- Pydantic-based `Company` model with comprehensive field validation

#### Error Handling
- Custom exception hierarchy for precise error handling:
  - `PyPlanhatError` - Base exception for all SDK errors
  - `APIConnectionError` - Network/timeout issues
  - `APIError` - Base for HTTP errors (includes status_code and response_body)
  - `AuthenticationError` - 401/403 authentication failures
  - `InvalidRequestError` - 400/404 bad requests
  - `RateLimitError` - 429 rate limit exceeded
  - `ServerError` - 5xx server errors

#### Architecture
- **Async-first DRY architecture** using `unasync` for code generation
- Zero duplication of business logic between async and sync implementations
- Single source of truth in `src/pyplanhat/_async/` directory
- Automated sync code generation via `scripts/generate_sync.py`

#### Type Safety
- Full mypy type checking support with strict mode
- Type hints throughout codebase
- Pydantic models for runtime validation

#### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 97% code coverage
- 52 tests covering both async and sync implementations
- Parallel test structure (`tests/_async/` and `tests/_sync/`)
- HTTP mocking with `pytest-httpx`
- Error scenario coverage (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 5xx)

- Comprehensive README with installation and quick start guides
- Async and sync usage examples
- Development setup and workflow documentation
- Architecture overview and design principles

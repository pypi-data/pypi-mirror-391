# Function Secrets for Local Testing
# These simulate the secrets that would be configured in CDF for your deployed function
# Only variables prefixed with CTF_SECRET_ are loaded as function secrets
# The prefix is stripped when injected into your function (e.g., CTF_SECRET_lightstep-token becomes "lightstep-token")

# LightStep Cloud access token
# Get this from: https://app.lightstep.com/settings/access-tokens
CTF_SECRET_lightstep-token=your-lightstep-access-token-here

# Well Log Toolkit

Fast LAS file processing with lazy loading and filtering for well log analysis.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient reading of large LAS files
- **Multi-well Management**: Orchestrate analysis across multiple wells
- **Property Filtering**: Chain filters on well log properties
- **Type Support**: Handle both continuous and discrete logs
- **Statistics**: Compute statistics on filtered data

## Installation

```bash
pip install well-log-toolkit
```

## Quick Start

```python
from well_log_toolkit import WellDataManager

# Load LAS files
manager = WellDataManager()
manager.load_las("well1.las").load_las("well2.las")

# Access well and properties
well = manager.well_36_7_5_B

# Mark discrete logs
well.get_property('Zone').type = 'discrete'
well.get_property('NTG_Flag').type = 'discrete'

# Filter and compute statistics
stats = well.phie.filter('Zone').filter('NTG_Flag').sums_avg()
```

### Well
Single well containing multiple properties with convenient property access.

### Property
Single log property with depth-value pairs and filtering operations.

### LasFile
LAS file reader with lazy loading capabilities.

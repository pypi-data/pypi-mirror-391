# Arkiv SDK

Arkiv is a permissioned storage system for decentralized apps, supporting flexible entities with binary data, attributes, and metadata.

The Arkiv SDK is the official Python library for interacting with Arkiv networks. It offers a type-safe, developer-friendly API for managing entities, querying data, subscribing to events, and offchain verification—ideal for both rapid prototyping and production use.

## Architecture

Principles:
- The SDK is based on a modern and stable client library.
- The SDK should feel like "Library + Entities"

As underlying library we use [Web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) (no good alternatives for Python).


### Arkiv Client

The Arkiv SDK should feel like "web3.py + entities", maintaining the familiar developer experience that Python web3 developers expect.

A `client.arkiv.*` approach is in line with web3.py's module pattern.
It clearly communicates that arkiv is a module extension just like eth, net, etc.

## Hello World

### Synchronous API
Here's a "Hello World!" example showing how to use the Python Arkiv SDK:

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv

# Create Arkiv client with default settings:
# - starting and connecting to a containerized Arkiv node
# - creating a funded default account
client = Arkiv()
print(f"Client: {client}, connected: {client.is_connected()}")
print(f"Account: {client.eth.default_account}")
print(f"Balance: {client.from_wei(client.eth.get_balance(client.eth.default_account), 'ether')} ETH")

# Create entity with data and attributes
entity_key, receipt = client.arkiv.create_entity(
    payload = b"Hello World!",
    content_type = "text/plain",
    attributes = {"type": "greeting", "version": 1},
    expires_in = client.arkiv.to_seconds(days=1)
)

# Get individual entity and print its details
entity = client.arkiv.get_entity(entity_key)
print(f"Creation TX: {receipt.tx_hash}")
print(f"Entity: {entity}")

# Clean up - delete entity
client.arkiv.delete_entity(entity_key)
print("Entity deleted")
```

### Asynchronous API
For async/await support, use `AsyncArkiv`:

```python
import asyncio
from arkiv import AsyncArkiv

async def main():
    # Create async client with default settings
    async with AsyncArkiv() as client:
        # Create entity with data and attributes
        entity_key, tx_hash = await client.arkiv.create_entity(
            payload = b"Hello Async World!",
            content_type = "text/plain",
            attributes = {"type": "greeting", "version": 1},
            expires_in = client.arkiv.to_seconds(days=1)
        )

        # Get entity and check existence
        entity = await client.arkiv.get_entity(entity_key)
        exists = await client.arkiv.entity_exists(entity_key)

        # Clean up - delete entity
        await client.arkiv.delete_entity(entity_key)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Web3 Standard Support
```python
from web3 import HTTPProvider
provider = HTTPProvider('https://kaolin.hoodi.arkiv.network/rpc')

# Arkiv 'is a' Web3 client
client = Arkiv(provider)
balance = client.eth.get_balance(client.eth.default_account)
tx = client.eth.get_transaction(tx_hash)
```

### Arkiv Module Extension
```python
from arkiv import Arkiv

# Simple local setup
client = Arkiv()

# Or with custom provider and account
from arkiv.account import NamedAccount
account = NamedAccount.from_wallet('Alice', wallet, 's3cret')
client = Arkiv(provider, account=account)

entity_key, tx_hash = client.arkiv.create_entity(
    payload = b"Hello World!",
    content_type = "text/plain",
    attributes = {"type": "greeting", "version": 1},
    expires_in = client.arkiv.to_seconds(hours=2)
)

entity = client.arkiv.get_entity(entity_key)
exists = client.arkiv.exists(entity_key)
  ```

## Advanced Features

### Provider Builder

The snippet below demonstrates the creation of various nodes to connect to using the `ProviderBuilder`.

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv
from arkiv.account import NamedAccount
from arkiv.provider import ProviderBuilder

### Provider Builder

The snippet below demonstrates the creation of various nodes to connect to using the `ProviderBuilder`.

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv
from arkiv.account import NamedAccount
from arkiv.provider import ProviderBuilder

# Create account from wallet json
with open ('wallet_bob.json', 'r') as f:
    wallet = f.read()

bob = NamedAccount.from_wallet('Bob', wallet, 's3cret')

# Initialize Arkiv client connected to Kaolin (Akriv testnet)
provider = ProviderBuilder().kaolin().build()
client = Arkiv(provider, account=bob)

# Additional builder examples
provider_custom = ProviderBuilder().custom("https://mendoza.hoodi.arkiv.network/rpc").build()
provider_container = ProviderBuilder().node().build()
provider_kaolin_ws = ProviderBuilder().kaolin().ws().build()
```

### Query Iterator

The `query_entities` method returns an iterator that automatically handles pagination, making it easy to work with large result sets:

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv
from arkiv.types import QueryOptions, KEY, ATTRIBUTES

client = Arkiv()

# Query entities with automatic pagination
query = 'type = "user" AND age > 18'
options = QueryOptions(fields=KEY | ATTRIBUTES, max_results_per_page=100)

# Iterate over all matching entities
# Pagination is handled automatically by the iterator
for entity in client.arkiv.query_entities(query=query, options=options):
    print(f"Entity {entity.key}: {entity.attributes}")

# Or collect all results into a list
entities = list(client.arkiv.query_entities(query=query, options=options))
print(f"Found {len(entities)} entities")
```

### Query Language

Arkiv uses a SQL-like query language to filter and retrieve entities based on their attributes. The query language supports standard comparison operators, logical operators, and parentheses for complex conditions.

#### Supported Operators

**Comparison Operators:**
- `=` - Equal to
- `!=` - Not equal to
- `>` - Greater than
- `>=` - Greater than or equal to
- `<` - Less than
- `<=` - Less than or equal to

**Logical Operators:**
- `AND` - Logical AND
- `OR` - Logical OR
- `NOT` - Logical NOT (can also use `!=`)

**Parentheses** can be used to group conditions and control evaluation order.

#### Query Examples

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv

client = Arkiv()

# Simple equality
query = 'type = "user"'
entities = list(client.arkiv.query_entities(query))

# Note that inn the examples below the call to query_entities is omitted

# Multiple conditions with AND
query = 'type = "user" AND status = "active"'

# OR conditions with parentheses
query = 'type = "user" AND (status = "active" OR status = "pending")'

# Comparison operators
query = 'type = "user" AND age >= 18 AND age < 65'

# NOT conditions
query = 'type = "user" AND status != "deleted"'

# Alternative NOT syntax
query = 'type = "user" AND NOT (status = "deleted")'

# Complex nested conditions
query = '(type = "user" OR type = "admin") AND (age >= 18 AND age <= 65)'

# Multiple NOT conditions
query = 'type = "user" AND status != "deleted" AND status != "banned"'

# Pattern matching with GLOB (using * as wildcard)
query = 'name GLOB "John*"'  # Names starting with "John"

# Pattern matching with suffix
query = 'email GLOB "*@example.com"'  # Emails ending with @example.com
```

**Note:** String values in queries must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`). Numeric values do not require quotes. The `GLOB` operator supports pattern matching using `*` as a wildcard character.
Note that the GLOB operator might be replace by a SQL standard LIKE operator in the future.

### Sorting

Query results can be sorted by one or more attribute fields in ascending or descending order. Sorting supports both string and numeric attributes, with multi-field sorting following priority order (first field has highest priority).

#### Basic Sorting

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv, ASC, DESC, STR, INT, OrderByAttribute, QueryOptions

client = Arkiv()

# Sort by string attribute (default sorting: ascending)
order_by = [OrderByAttribute(attribute="name", type=STR)]
options = QueryOptions(order_by=order_by)
entities = list(client.arkiv.query_entities('type = "user"', options=options))

# Sort by numeric attribute (descending, needs to be set explicitly)
order_by = [OrderByAttribute(attribute="age", type=INT, direction=DESC)]
options = QueryOptions(order_by=order_by)
entities = list(client.arkiv.query_entities('type = "user"', options=options))
```

#### Multi-Attribute Sorting

When sorting by multiple attributes, the first attribute has the highest priority, with subsequent attributes acting as tie-breakers:

```python
# Sort by status (ascending), then by age (descending)
order_by = [
    OrderByAttribute(attribute="status", type=STR, direction=ASC),
    OrderByAttribute(attribute="age", type=INT, direction=DESC),
]
options = QueryOptions(order_by=order_by)
entities = list(client.arkiv.query_entities('type = "user"', options=options))

# Three-level sorting: type, then priority, then name
order_by = [
    OrderByAttribute(attribute="type", type=STR),
    OrderByAttribute(attribute="priority", type=INT, direction=DESC),
    OrderByAttribute(attribute="name", type=STR),
]
options = QueryOptions(order_by=order_by)
entities = list(client.arkiv.query_entities('status = "active"', options=options))
```

### Watch Entity Events

Arkiv provides near real-time event monitoring for entity lifecycle changes. You can watch for entity creation, updates, extensions, deletions, and ownership changes using callback-based event filters.

#### Available Event Types

- **`watch_entity_created`** - Monitor when new entities are created
- **`watch_entity_updated`** - Monitor when entities are updated
- **`watch_entity_extended`** - Monitor when entity lifetimes are extended
- **`watch_entity_deleted`** - Monitor when entities are deleted
- **`watch_owner_changed`** - Monitor when entity ownership changes

#### Basic Usage

```python
from arkiv import Arkiv

client = Arkiv()

# Define callback function to handle events
def on_entity_created(event, tx_hash):
    print(f"New entity created: {event.key}")
    print(f"Owner: {event.owner}")
    print(f"Transaction: {tx_hash}")

# Start watching for entity creation events
event_filter = client.arkiv.watch_entity_created(on_entity_created)

# Create an entity - callback will be triggered
entity_key, _ = client.arkiv.create_entity(
    payload=b"Hello World",
    attributes={"type": "greeting"}
)

# Stop watching when done
event_filter.stop()
event_filter.uninstall()
```

#### Watching Multiple Event Types

```python
created_events = []
updated_events = []
deleted_events = []

def on_created(event, tx_hash):
    created_events.append((event, tx_hash))

def on_updated(event, tx_hash):
    updated_events.append((event, tx_hash))

def on_deleted(event, tx_hash):
    deleted_events.append((event, tx_hash))

# Watch multiple event types simultaneously
filter_created = client.arkiv.watch_entity_created(on_created)
filter_updated = client.arkiv.watch_entity_updated(on_updated)
filter_deleted = client.arkiv.watch_entity_deleted(on_deleted)

# Perform operations...
# Events are captured in real-time

# Cleanup all filters
filter_created.uninstall()
filter_updated.uninstall()
filter_deleted.uninstall()
```

#### Historical Events

By default, watchers only capture new events from the current block forward. You can also watch from a specific historical block:

```python
# Watch from a specific block number
event_filter = client.arkiv.watch_entity_created(
    on_entity_created,
    from_block=1000
)

# Watch from the beginning of the chain
event_filter = client.arkiv.watch_entity_created(
    on_entity_created,
    from_block=0
)
```

#### Automatic Cleanup

When using Arkiv as a context manager, all event filters are automatically cleaned up on exit:

```python
with Arkiv() as client:
    # Create event filters
    filter1 = client.arkiv.watch_entity_created(callback1)
    filter2 = client.arkiv.watch_entity_updated(callback2)

    # Perform operations...
    # Filters are automatically stopped and uninstalled when exiting context
```

You can also manually clean up all active filters:

```python
client.arkiv.cleanup_filters()
```

**Note:** Event watching requires polling the node for new events. The SDK handles this automatically in the background.

## Arkiv Topics/Features

### Other Features

- **Creation Flags**: Entities should support creation-time flags with meaningful defaults.
Flags can only be set at creation and define entity behavior:
  - **Read-only**: Once created, entity data cannot be changed by anyone (immutable)
  - **Unpermissioned extension**: Entity lifetime can be extended by anyone, not just the owner
  ```python
  # Proposed API
  client.arkiv.create_entity(
      payload=b"data",
      attributes={"type": "public"},
      expires_at_block=future_block,
      flags=EntityFlags.READ_ONLY | EntityFlags.PUBLIC_EXTENSION
  )
  ```

- **ETH Transfers**: Arkiv chains should support ETH (or native token like GLM) transfers for gas fees and value transfer.
  ```python
  # Already supported via Web3.py compatibility
  tx_hash = client.eth.send_transaction({
      'to': recipient_address,
      'value': client.to_wei(1, 'ether'),
      'gas': 21000
  })
  ```

- **Offline Entity Verification**: Provide cryptographic verification of entity data without querying the chain.
  - Currently not supported
  - Proposal: Store entity keys (and block number) in smart contracts and work with an optimistic oracle approach (challenger may take entity key and checks claimed data against the data of an Arkiv archival node)

## Development Guide

### Branches, Versions, Changes

#### Branches

The current stable branch on Git is `main`.
Currently `main` hosts the initial SDK implementation.

The branch `v1-dev` hosts the future V1.0 SDK release.

#### Versions

For version management the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package and project manger is used.
Use the command below to display the current version
```bash
uv version
```

SDK versions are tracked in the following files:
- `pyproject.toml`
- `uv.lock`

### Testing

Pytest is used for unit and integration testing.
```bash
uv run pytest # Run all tests
uv run pytest -k test_create_entity_simple --log-cli-level=info # Specific tests via keyword, print at info log level
```

If an `.env` file is present the unit tests are run against the specifice RPC coordinates and test accounts.
An example wallet file is provided in `.env.testing`
Make sure that the specified test accounts are properly funded before running the tests.

Otherwise, the tests are run against a testcontainer containing an Arkiv RPC Node.
Test accounts are created on the fly and using the CLI inside the local RPC Nonde.

Account wallets for such tests can be created via the command shown below.
The provided example creates the wallet file `wallet_alice.json` using the password provided during the execution of the command.

```bash
uv run python uv run python -m arkiv.account alice
```

### Code Quality

This project uses comprehensive unit testing, linting and type checking to maintain high code quality:

#### Quick Commands

Before any commit run quality checks:
```bash
./scripts/check-all.sh
```

#### Tools Used

- **MyPy**: Static type checker with strict configuration
- **Ruff**: Fast linter and formatter (replaces black, isort, flake8, etc.)
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks on git commits

#### Individual commands
```bash
uv run ruff check . --fix    # Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff format .         # Format code
uv run mypy src/ tests/      # Type check
uv run pytest tests/ -v     # Run tests
uv run pytest --cov=src   # Run code coverage
uv run pre-commit run --all-files # Manual pre commit checks
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on `git commit` and will:
- Fix linting issues with ruff
- Format code consistently
- Run type checking with mypy
- Check file formatting (trailing whitespace, etc.)

#### MyPy Settings

- `strict = true` - Enable all strict checks
- `no_implicit_reexport = true` - Require explicit re-exports
- `warn_return_any = true` - Warn about returning Any values
- Missing imports are ignored for third-party libraries without type stubs

#### Ruff Configuration

- Use 88 character line length (Black-compatible)
- Target Python 3.12+ features
- Enable comprehensive rule sets (pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, etc.)
- Auto-fix issues where possible
- Format with double quotes and trailing commas

## Alias

```bash
function gl { git log --format="%C(green)%ad%C(reset) %C(yellow)%h%C(reset)%C(auto)%d%C(reset) %s" --date=format:"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S" -n ${1:-10}; }
alias gs='git status'
```

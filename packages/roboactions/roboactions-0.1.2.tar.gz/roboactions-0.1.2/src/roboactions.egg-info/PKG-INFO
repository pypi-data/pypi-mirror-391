              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# RoboActions Python SDK

Official Python SDK for the [RoboActions](https://www.roboactions.com) platform. It
provides a typed, ergonomic Python interface for interacting with deployed VLA policies, enabling
you to retrieve policy metadata, check health status, and run inference directly from Python
applications, scripts, or notebooks.

> **Status**: Pre-release (`0.1.0`). The surface area will grow as additional endpoints become
> publicly available. Follow the release notes before upgrading minor versions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install roboactions
```

## Quick Start

```python
from roboactions import RemotePolicy

# Create a policy client (automatically reads ROBOACTIONS_API_KEY from environment)
policy = RemotePolicy(policy_id="my-policy-id")

# Check policy health
status = policy.status()
print(f"Policy status: {status.value}")

# Get input/output feature schemas
input_features = policy.input_features()
output_features = policy.output_features()

# Discover existing policies
policies = RemotePolicy.list()
for summary in policies:
    print(f"{summary.policy_id}: {summary.display_name}")

# Run inference
observation = {
    "observation_image": image_array,
    "observation_state": state_array,
    "task": "pick up the cup"
}
action = policy.select_action(observation)
print(f"Predicted action: {action}")

# Predict multiple timesteps at once
action_chunk = policy.predict_action_chunk(observation)
print(f"Chunked action output: {action_chunk}")
```

## Authentication

All requests require an API key with access to the RoboActions workspace. Create and manage keys in
the RoboActions dashboard.

The SDK automatically reads the `ROBOACTIONS_API_KEY` environment variable:

```python
from roboactions import RemotePolicy

# Automatically uses ROBOACTIONS_API_KEY from environment
policy = RemotePolicy(policy_id="my-policy-id")
```

You can also provide the API key explicitly:

```python
from roboactions import RemotePolicy

policy = RemotePolicy(
    policy_id="my-policy-id",
    api_key="rk_live_abc123"  # Explicit API key
)
```

For security, it's recommended to use environment variables rather than hardcoding keys in your source code.

## Creating Policies

Use `RemotePolicy.create` to provision a policy directly from the SDK. The method handles authentication, and returns a ready-to-use client. Persist the returned `policy_id` if you plan to reconnect later. Set `compute_type` to `"CPU"` or `"GPU"` (default).

```python
from roboactions import RemotePolicy

policy = RemotePolicy.create(
    huggingface_model_id="my-org/my-robot-policy",
    compute_type="CPU",  # optional; defaults to "GPU"
    # api_key="rk_live_abc123",  # optional overrides
)

print(f"New policy: {policy.policy_id}")

# Reconnect elsewhere in your application with the policy ID
reconnected = RemotePolicy(policy_id=policy.policy_id)
```

## Core Features

### Policy Management

```python
# List all policies the current API key can access
from roboactions import RemotePolicy

policies = RemotePolicy.list()
for summary in policies:
    print(f"{summary.policy_id}: {summary.display_name}")

# Delete a policy you no longer need
policy = RemotePolicy(policy_id="my-policy-id")
delete_result = policy.delete()
print(f"Delete response: {delete_result}")
```

### Health Checks

```python
# Simple boolean check
if policy.ping():
    print("Policy is reachable")

# Detailed status with enum
from roboactions import PolicyStatus

status = policy.status()
if status == PolicyStatus.HEALTHY:
    print("Policy is ready for inference")
elif status == PolicyStatus.DEPLOYING:
    print("Policy is still deploying...")
```

### Wait for Deployment

```python
# Block until policy is deployed
final_status = policy.wait_until_deployed(interval=5.0)
if final_status == PolicyStatus.HEALTHY:
    print("Policy is now ready!")
```

### Reset Policy State

```python
# Reset the policy state (useful for stateful policies between episodes)
result = policy.reset()
if result.get("reset"):
    print("Policy reset successfully")
else:
    print(f"Reset failed: {result.get('error')}")
```

### Inference

```python
# Single action prediction
action = policy.select_action(observation)

# Action chunk prediction (for temporal policies)
action_chunk = policy.predict_action_chunk(observation)
```

### Sample Input Generation

```python
# Generate random sample inputs (useful for testing)
sample_inputs = policy.sample_observation()
action = policy.select_action(sample_inputs)
```

### Observation Shapes Cache

```python
# Retrieve observation tensor dimensions discovered via input_features
policy.input_features()
for key, shape in policy.observation_shapes:
    print(f"{key}: {shape}")
```

## Remote Gymnasium Environments

Interact with Gymnasium-compatible environments hosted via RoboActions over a secure WebSocket.

```python
from roboactions import remotegym

# Reads ROBOACTIONS_API_KEY from environment if not provided explicitly
env = remotegym.make("CartPole-v1", render_mode="rgb_array")

# Standard Gymnasium flow
obs, info = env.reset(seed=123)
for _ in range(100):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # gymnasium.spaces.Space
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    frame = env.render()  # numpy.ndarray (H, W, 3) when render_mode == "rgb_array"
    if terminated or truncated:
        obs, info = env.reset()
env.close()
```

Notes:
- `render()` returns a NumPy RGB array when `render_mode="rgb_array"`; otherwise returns `None`.
- The client pre-validates actions using the real Gymnasium `action_space`.
- If a step ends an episode, call `reset()` before the next `step()`.
- On connect, the server performs `reset(seed=seed)` and returns the initial `observation` and `info`.
- Additional properties exposed:
  - `observation_space`: Gymnasium space describing observations
  - `metadata`: Full `env.metadata` dict (e.g., `render_modes`, `render_fps`)
  - `spec`: `None` (standard Gymnasium attribute); raw mapping available via `server_spec`
  - `initial_observation`, `initial_info`: Values returned alongside `make_ok`
  - `render_mode`: The render mode passed at construction
  - `reward_range`: Default `(-inf, inf)` per Gymnasium

## Configuration

- **Retries (HTTP):** Configure automatic retries with `RemotePolicy(..., retries=RetryConfig())`
- **Timeouts (HTTP):** Set per-request timeouts via `policy.status(timeout=5.0)`
- **Retries (RemoteEnv WebSocket):** Enable connection retry/backoff with `RemoteEnv(..., retries=RetryConfig())` or via the helper `remotegym.make(..., retries=RetryConfig())`. Transient handshake failures (e.g., 408/429/5xx) are retried up to `max_attempts` with exponential backoff using `backoff_factor`. Authentication and other non-transient errors are not retried.
- **Timeouts (RemoteEnv WebSocket):** Control the WebSocket connect timeout with `RemoteEnv(..., timeout=...)` or `remotegym.make(..., timeout=...)`. Defaults: `60s` when constructing `RemoteEnv` directly; `10s` when using `remotegym.make` unless overridden.
- **Custom base URL:** Override `base_url` to point at staging or self-hosted deployments
- **Context Manager:** Use `with RemotePolicy(...) as policy:` for automatic session cleanup

## Exception Handling

```python
from roboactions import (
    RemotePolicy,
    RoboActionsError,
    AuthenticationError,
    RateLimitError
)

try:
    policy = RemotePolicy(policy_id="my-policy", api_key="invalid-key")
    action = policy.select_action(observation)
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Invalid API key")
except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limited. Retry after {e.retry_after} seconds")
except RoboActionsError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
```

## Development

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies with `pip install -e .[dev]`.
2. Run formatting and lint checks using `ruff check .`.
3. Execute the test suite via `pytest`.

## Releasing

1. Update `src/roboactions/_version.py`.
2. Build artifacts: `python -m build`.
3. Upload to PyPI (test or prod) using `twine upload dist/*`.

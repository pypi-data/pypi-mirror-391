## Why Pollywog?

If you work with [Leapfrog](https://www.seequent.com/products-solutions/leapfrog-geo/) for geological modeling and resource estimation, you know that building calculation sets (`.lfcalc` files) manually can be:

- **Time-consuming** – Repetitive point-and-click operations
- **Error-prone** – Easy to make mistakes in complex formulas
- **Hard to maintain** – Difficult to update across multiple projects
- **Not version-controlled** – Changes are hard to track and review
- **Not automatable** – Can't script or integrate with other tools

**Pollywog solves these problems** by letting you define calculations in Python code that is:

- Programmatic and automatable
- Version-controlled (Git-friendly)
- Testable and reproducible
- Easy to refactor and maintain
- Integrated with ML pipelines (scikit-learn)

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Read and write** `.lfcalc` files programmatically
- **Create calculations** with Python classes (`Number`, `Category`, `If`, etc.)
- **Query and filter** calculation sets like pandas DataFrames
- **Topological sorting** for automatic dependency resolution
- **Rich display** in Jupyter notebooks with interactive trees

### Helper Functions
- **Mathematical operations**: `Sum`, `Product`, `Average`, `WeightedAverage`
- **Transformations**: `Scale`, `Normalize`
- **Classification**: `CategoryFromThresholds`
- **Dual mode**: Return complete calculations (with `name`) or expressions (without `name`) for composition

### Machine Learning Integration
- Convert **scikit-learn decision trees** to Leapfrog calculations
- Convert **random forests** to ensemble calculations
- Convert **linear models** to equations
- Support for both **regression and classification**

### Domain-Based Calculations
- Multi-domain resource modeling
- Weighted averages by domain proportions
- Conditional logic for different geological units

## Quick Start

```python
from pollywog.core import CalcSet, Number
from pollywog.helpers import WeightedAverage

# Create a calculation set
calcset = CalcSet([
    # Clean data
    Number("Au_clean", "clamp([Au], 0)",
           comment_equation="Remove negative values"),

    # Domain-weighted grade
    WeightedAverage(
        variables=["Au_oxide", "Au_sulfide", "Au_transition"],
        weights=["prop_oxide", "prop_sulfide", "prop_transition"],
        name="Au_composite",
        comment="Domain-weighted gold grade"
    ),

    # Apply recovery
    Number("Au_recovered", "[Au_composite] * 0.88",
           comment_equation="88% metallurgical recovery"),
])

# Export to Leapfrog
calcset.to_lfcalc("my_calculations.lfcalc")
```

Then import `my_calculations.lfcalc` into Leapfrog and you're done! ✨

> ⚠️ **Note**: Pollywog is in active development. Always backup your Leapfrog projects before testing. Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/endarthur/pollywog/issues).

Important:
- Pollywog is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Seequent or any company associated with Leapfrog
- Use of this tool does not violate Leapfrog’s license terms or Seequent’s policies

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install lf_pollywog
```

### From GitHub (Latest Development Version)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/endarthur/pollywog.git
```

### Try in Your Browser (No Installation)

Try Pollywog without installing anything using **JupyterLite**: [https://endarthur.github.io/pollyweb](https://endarthur.github.io/pollyweb)

> **Note**: JupyterLite runs in your browser and has limitations (no file system access, limited libraries). Files are stored in browser memory and won't persist if you clear your cache. Download your work regularly! For production use, preferably install locally.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Reading and Writing `.lfcalc` Files

```python
from pollywog.core import CalcSet, Number

# Read existing file
calcset = CalcSet.read_lfcalc("path/to/file.lfcalc")

# Modify calculations
calcset.items.append(Number("new_calc", "[Au] * 2"))

# Export modified version
calcset.to_lfcalc("output.lfcalc")
```

### 2. Creating Calculations from Scratch

```python
from pollywog.core import Number, CalcSet

calcset = CalcSet([
    Number("Au_clean", "clamp([Au], 0)",
           comment_equation="Remove negative values"),
    Number("Au_log", "log([Au_clean] + 1e-6)",
           comment_equation="Log transform for kriging"),
])

calcset.to_lfcalc("drillhole_preprocessing.lfcalc")
```

### 3. Using Helper Functions

Helpers can return either complete calculations or just expressions for composition:

```python
from pollywog.helpers import WeightedAverage, Product, CategoryFromThresholds
from pollywog.core import CalcSet, Number

calcset = CalcSet([
    # With name: Returns complete Number object
    WeightedAverage(
        variables=["Au_oxide", "Au_sulfide", "Au_transition"],
        weights=["prop_oxide", "prop_sulfide", "prop_transition"],
        name="Au_composite",
        comment="Domain-weighted gold grade"
    ),

    # Calculate gold equivalent (Ag and Cu converted to Au)
    Number("AuEq",
        "[Au_composite] + ([Ag_composite] * 0.011) + ([Cu_composite] * 1.5)",
        comment_equation="Gold equivalent grade (Ag/91, Cu*1.5 for price ratio)"
    ),

    # Without name: Returns expression for composition
    # Calculate net smelter return (NSR) per tonne
    Number("NSR_per_tonne",
        f"{Product(['Au_composite', '1800', '0.88'])} + "  # Au: price $1800/oz, 88% recovery
        f"{Product(['Ag_composite', '22', '0.75'])} + "    # Ag: price $22/oz, 75% recovery
        f"{Product(['Cu_composite', '3.5', '0.85'])}"      # Cu: price $3.5/lb, 85% recovery
    ),

    # Classify by gold equivalent grade
    CategoryFromThresholds(
        variable="AuEq",
        thresholds=[0.5, 2.0],
        categories=["waste", "low_grade", "high_grade"],
        name="ore_class"
    ),
])

calcset.to_lfcalc("resource_model.lfcalc")
```

### 4. Machine Learning Model Conversion

Deploy machine learning models directly in Leapfrog:

```python
from pollywog.conversion.sklearn import convert_tree, convert_forest
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from pollywog.core import CalcSet
import numpy as np

# Training data: Au grade, Cu grade, grind size (P80)
X = np.array([[1.2, 0.3, 75], [0.8, 0.5, 100], [2.0, 0.2, 75]])
y = np.array([0.88, 0.82, 0.91])  # Recovery values

# Train and convert decision tree
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)

recovery_calc = convert_tree(
    model,
    ["Au_composite", "Cu_composite", "P80"],
    "Au_recovery_predicted"
)

# Export to Leapfrog
CalcSet([recovery_calc]).to_lfcalc("ml_recovery_model.lfcalc")
```

### 5. Domain-Based Calculations

```python
from pollywog.core import CalcSet, Number, If
from pollywog.helpers import WeightedAverage

domains = ["oxide", "transition", "sulfide"]
metals = ["Au", "Ag", "Cu"]

# Domain-weighted grades for all metals
calcset = CalcSet([
    WeightedAverage(
        variables=[f"{metal}_{domain}" for domain in domains],
        weights=[f"prop_{domain}" for domain in domains],
        name=f"{metal}_composite",
        comment=f"Domain-weighted {metal} grade"
    )
    for metal in metals
])

# Apply domain-specific recovery
# Note: If objects require a list since they are separate structures
calcset.items.append(
    Number("Au_recovered", [
        If([
            ("[domain] = 'oxide'", "[Au_composite] * 0.92"),
            ("[domain] = 'transition'", "[Au_composite] * 0.85"),
            ("[domain] = 'sulfide'", "[Au_composite] * 0.78"),
        ], otherwise=["[Au_composite] * 0.75"])
    ])
)

calcset.to_lfcalc("multi_domain_workflow.lfcalc")
```

### 6. Querying CalcSets

Filter calculations like pandas DataFrames:

```python
# Select items by name pattern
au_calcs = calcset.query('name.startswith("Au")')

# Use external variables
metals_of_interest = ["Au", "Ag"]
selected = calcset.query('any(name.startswith(m) for m in @metals_of_interest)')

# Complex queries
filtered = calcset.query('len(expression) > 1 and "log" in name')
```

- Use item attributes (e.g., `name`, `item_type`) in expressions.
- Reference external variables using `@var` syntax (e.g., `name.startswith(@prefix)`).
- Supported helpers: `len`, `any`, `all`, `min`, `max`, `sorted`, `re`, `str`.

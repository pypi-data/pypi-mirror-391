# Project Aria Client SDK For Python

- Aria Gen1 Client SDK
- Aria Gen2 Client SDK

# Aria Gen1 Client SDK

The Project Aria Client SDK with CLI provides robust capabilities for creating computer
vision and machine learning applications with the Project Aria glasses.

The Client SDK currently offers the ability to:
- Connect and disconnect from the device via USB and WiFi
- Retrieve detailed device information and its current status
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities
- Access calibration data for the sensors you're recording with
- Subscribe and listen to Aria sensors data
- Visualize streaming data

A CLI is installed as part of the SDK, which provides the ability to:
- Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 - 3.11
- Platform: Mac Big Sur+, Fedora 36+, Ubuntu 22.04+
- A router such as Asus, Netgear or TP-Link with no firewall that supports Wi-Fi
  6 to connect the glasses to the 5GHz band for when streaming over Wi-Fi
- Update your glasses to the latest OS using the Aria Mobile Companion App

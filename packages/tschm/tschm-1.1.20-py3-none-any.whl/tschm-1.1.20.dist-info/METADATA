# TSCHM - Windows Task Scheduler Manager

A powerful Windows task scheduler management tool that enables scheduled tasks to execute even when your computer is in sleep mode.

- ✅ Execute scheduled tasks during system sleep mode
- ✅ Simple command-line interface via `tsm` command
- ✅ Manage hidden tasks with ease
- ✅ Kill running scheduled tasks on demand

Most Windows task management tools fail to execute tasks when the system is in sleep mode. TSCHM was specifically designed to solve this critical limitation, ensuring your scheduled tasks run reliably regardless of system power state.

```bash
pip install tschm -U

uv tool install tschm -U
```

After installation, the `tsm` command will be available in your terminal.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Python 3.13+

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the `tsm` command to manage your scheduled tasks:

"""
An example of fast-running tests, as the transaction for both the test and
    the application is shared.
This allows data isolation to be achieved by rolling back the transaction
    rather than deleting data from tables.

It's not exactly fair testing, because the app doesn't manage the session
    itself.
But for most basic tests, it's sufficient.
On the plus side, these tests run faster.

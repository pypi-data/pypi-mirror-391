The most recent version of CamML can be install via [![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/caml.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/caml):

```bash
pip install caml
```

and pinned to a specific version via:

```bash
pip install caml=={version}
```

To install optional/extra dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install 'caml[extra]'
```

We currently support the following extras: `spark` & `ray`. These can be leveraged when
running `AutoCATE` class with `spark` or `ray` backend.

**Note:** CaML is in a highly experimental state and no stable release exists.
Breaking changes to the API may occur at any time.

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/legout/fsspeckit.git
    cd fsspeckit
    ```
2.  **Install `uv`**:
    `fsspeckit` uses `uv` for dependency management and running commands. If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it via `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
3.  **Install Development Dependencies**:
    The project uses `uv` to manage dependencies. Install the `dev` dependency group which includes tools for testing, linting, and documentation generation.
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
    This command installs the project in editable mode (`-e`) and includes all development-related dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` under the `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` section.

## Best Practices for Contributions

-   **Code Style**: Adhere to the existing code style. We use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
-   **Testing**: All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by relevant unit tests.
-   **Documentation**: If your changes introduce new features or modify existing behavior, please update the documentation accordingly.
-   **Commit Messages**: Write descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
-   **Atomic Commits**: Try to keep your commits focused on a single logical change.
-   **Branch Naming**: Use clear and concise branch names (e.g., `feature/new-feature`, `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).

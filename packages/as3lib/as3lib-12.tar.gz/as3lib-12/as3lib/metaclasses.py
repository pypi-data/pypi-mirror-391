class _AS3_CONSTANTSOBJECT(type):
   '''
   Metaclass for objects defining as3 constants.
   Objects with this as a metaclass can:
      - be enumerated
   Objects with this as a metaclass can not:
      - have subclasses
      - have objects inside defined or modified after creation (python has a way around this but please don't)
      - be instantiated properly. You can instantiate these but they will not have any of the functions available to them. This is a weakness of metaclasses and the way python does things.

# python-as3lib

A partial implementation of ActionScript 3 and the adobe flash api in python. This project aims to have as accurate of an implementation as possible of the implemented features, however anything that isn't documented won't be implemented unless I am informed about it. Some stuff will be impossible to implement in python because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock">python is a fish</a>.

## Notes

- If you need acuracy, use <a href="https://ruffle.rs">ruffle</a> instead. This library is developed for the purpose of making game porting easier and is developed by one person.
- Versions of this library before 0.0.6 are broken on windows.
- Tkinter can not fetch the information needed when used on wayland (linux). It must be manually entered into as3lib.toml. I plan on making this less painfull later.
- Use of multiple displays has not been tested yet.
- interface_tk is a testing module, it does not function like actionscript and is only there to work things out. Do not expect consistency between versions and do not expect it to be kept around.
- Using "from as3lib import *" imports all ActionScript toplevel stuff with int renamed to Int so it doesn't conflict with python's int.
- The toplevel module is now deprecated and only remains for backwards compatibility. Import the library instead.

## Requirements

> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numpy">numpy</a>
> <br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow">Pillow</a>
> <br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/tkhtmlview">tkhtmlview</a>
> <br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/tomli/">tomli</a> (python < 3.11)
> <br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/as3lib-miniAMF/">as3lib-miniAMF</a>

Windows specific<br>
> PyLaucher
> <br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/">pywin32</a>

Unix specific<br>
> a posix compatible shell, grep, which
> <br>(xorg): xwininfo, xrandr

This library also makes use of the following python builtin modules: tkinter, re, math, io, platform, subprocess, random, time, datetime, os, pwd (linux), pathlib, configparser, webbrowser, textwrap, typing, tomllib

## Config Files

<b>&lt;library-directory&gt;/as3lib.toml</b> - This library's config file. This includes mm.cfg and wayland.cfg that were included in previous versions. Old config files will only be migrated if this file does not exist or if "migrateOldConfig" is set to true.

<b><u>DEPRECATED</u> &lt;library-directory&gt;/as3lib.cfg</b> - The config file used by version 0.0.11.

<b><u>DEPRECATED</u> &lt;library-directory&gt;/wayland.cfg</b> - Generated on versions before 0.0.11 to hold the values that can not be fetched automatically on wayland (linux). Now integrated into as3lib.toml.

<b><u>DEPRECATED</u> &lt;library-directory&gt;/mm.cfg</b> - Place your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180227100916/helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/configure-debugger-version-flash-player.html">mm.cfg</a> file from adobe flash player here before first running this library if you want to automatically migrate it. Will not be deleted after migration.

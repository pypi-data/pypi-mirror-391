    You can import the `MLPRegressorSolution` class directly from `neural_network`:

    ```python
    from nextmv_sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressorSolution
    ```

    This class provides a Pydantic model representation of scikit-learn's MLPRegressor
    model, enabling serialization, deserialization, and conversion between model formats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss_ : float, default=0.0
        The current loss computed with the loss function.
    best_loss_ : float, default=0.0
        The minimum loss reached by the solver throughout fitting.
    loss_curve_ : list[np.float64], optional
        Loss value evaluated at the end of each training step.
    validation_scores_ : list[float], optional
        The score at each iteration on a held-out validation set.
    best_validation_score_ : float, optional
        The best validation score (i.e. R2 score) that triggered the early stopping.
    t_ : int, default=0
        The number of training samples seen by the solver during fitting.
    coefs_ : list[ndarray], optional
        The ith element in the list represents the weight matrix corresponding to layer i.
    intercepts_ : list[ndarray], optional
        The ith element in the list represents the bias vector corresponding to layer i + 1.
    n_features_in_ : int, default=0
        Number of features seen during fit.
    feature_names_in_ : ndarray, optional
        Names of features seen during fit.
    n_iter_ : int, default=0
        The number of iterations the solver has run.
    n_layers_ : int, default=0
        Number of layers.
    n_outputs_ : int, default=0
        Number of outputs.
    out_activation_ : str, optional
        Name of the output activation function.

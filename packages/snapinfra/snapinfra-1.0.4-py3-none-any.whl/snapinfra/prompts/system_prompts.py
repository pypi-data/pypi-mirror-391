## CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS - MUST FOLLOW

### 1. SYNTAX AND FORMAT VALIDATION
- JSON files MUST contain ONLY valid JSON syntax (no explanatory text, no code blocks)
- YAML files must use spaces, never tabs for indentation
- All configuration files must be syntactically correct and parseable
- Python code must be syntactically valid and compile without errors
- JavaScript/TypeScript must have balanced braces and valid syntax
- Dockerfile must have proper FROM instruction and specific version tags

### 2. IMPORT AND REFERENCE CONSISTENCY
- ALL import statements must reference files that exist in the generated output
- ALL file names must match exactly (case-sensitive) across imports
- ALL API endpoints referenced in frontend must exist in backend
- ALL environment variables referenced must be documented in .env.example
- ALL function/class references must have corresponding implementations

### 3. TECHNOLOGY STACK COHERENCE
- Choose ONE consistent technology stack (never mix incompatible technologies)
- If web app: Use React/Vue + Node.js/Python backend (not desktop frameworks)
- If desktop app: Use PyQt/Tkinter + Python backend (not web frameworks)
- If mobile: Use React Native/Flutter + appropriate backend
- Never mix multiple frontend frameworks (React + Vue + Angular)
- Never mix multiple Python web frameworks (Flask + Django + FastAPI)

### 4. ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY
- Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout all files
- Use consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- Implement consistent logging and monitoring approaches
- Follow consistent security patterns and authentication methods
- Choose clear architectural pattern (MVC, microservices, monolith) and stick to it

### 5. IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETENESS
- Every referenced function/class/component MUST be fully implemented
- Every API endpoint called from frontend MUST have backend implementation
- Every database operation MUST be supported by generated schema
- Every test MUST test actual implemented functionality (not placeholder code)
- Every dependency MUST be listed in appropriate package files

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

SimGrid is a scientific instrument to study the behavior of large-scale distributed systems such as Grids, Clouds, HPC or P2P systems. It can be used to evaluate heuristics, prototype applications or even assess legacy MPI applications.

This package contains a native library. Please install cmake, boost, pybind11 and a C++ compiler before using pip3. On Debian/Ubuntu, this is as easy as
sudo apt install cmake libboost-dev pybind11-dev g++ gcc

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Python Bindings of Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator

```text

```

## Introduction

This project provides Python bindings for the [Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim). The Pythonic Spike (or PySpike) opens up Spike's C++ internals (such as RISC-V disassembler, processors, controllers, peripherals, etc.) for interoperation with Python scripts. It enables users to write ISA / RoCC extensions and MMIO device models in Python, and plug them into vanilla Spike for (co-)simulating complex hardware systems. Through integrating Spike more seamlessly into the Python ecosystem, PySpike aims to boost the agility of Python-based hardware verification tools and workflows.

PyPI package: [`spike`](https://pypi.org/project/spike/)


## Getting Started

PySpike requires: Python 3.8+.

Install the wheel package with `pip`.

```shell
$ pip install --pre spike
```

PySpike ships the original command-line tool `spike`, a.k.a *vanilla Spike*, within its wheel package. You can confirm its availability using,

```shell
$ spike --help
Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator 1.1.1-dev
...
```

There is also a 100%-compatible command-line wrapper called `pyspike`, with additional support for Python-based ISA / MMIO / RoCC extensions via `--extlib=<name>`.

```shell
$ pyspike \
    --isa=rv32imc_xmyisa --priv=m \
    --pc=0x90000000 \
    -m0x90000000:0x4000000 \
    --extlib=myisa.py \
    --extlib=mydev.py \
    --device=mydev,0x20000000 \
    tests/data/libc-printf_hello.elf
Hello, World!
```

### Quick ISA Extension

An ISA extension implements one or more custom instructions and / or control-state registers (CSRs) for Spike's RISC-V processor models. With PySpike, an ISA extension is a Python class that inherits `riscv.isa.ISA`. It should implement a minimum of two methods: `get_instructions` and `get_disasms`. The former provides functional models of one or more custom instructions, and the latter provides their disassemblers. Other optional methods include `get_csrs` and `reset`, for providing custom CSRs and resetting extension states, respectively. Use decorator `@isa.register("myisa")` to register the extension under the name `myisa`.

```python
from typing import List
from riscv import isa
from riscv.csrs import csr_t
from riscv.disasm import disasm_insn_t
from riscv.processor import insn_desc_t, processor_t

@isa.register("myisa")
class MyISA(isa.ISA):
    def __init__(self): ...
    def get_instructions(self, proc: processor_t) -> List[insn_desc_t]: ...
    def get_disasms(self, proc: processor_t) -> List[disasm_insn_t]: ...
    def get_csrs(self, proc: processor_t) -> List[csr_t]: ...
    def reset(self, proc: processor_t) -> None: ...
```

### Quick Device Model

Likewise to the ISA extension, a device model implements a custom *memory-mapped input/output* (MMIO) peripheral for Spike's simulated system bus. With PySpike, a device model is a Python class that inherits `riscv.dev.MMIO`. It should implement a minimum of three methods: `__init__`, `load`, and `store`. The former initializes the model, the latter two handle memory read and write operations. Other optional methods include `size` and `tick`, for obtaining the size of memory-mapped address space, and shifting device states, respectively. Use decorator `@dev.register("mydev")` to register the model under the name `mydev`.

```python
from typing import Optional
from riscv import dev
from riscv.sim import sim_t

@dev.register("mydev")
class MyDEV(dev.MMIO):
    def __init__(self, sim: sim_t, args: Optional[str] = None): ...
    def load(self, addr: int, size: int) -> bytes: ...
    def store(self, addr: int, data: bytes) -> None: ...
    def size(self) -> int: ...
    def tick(self, rtc_ticks: int) -> None:
```

## Development

### Getting Source Code

```shell
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/huimtlab/pyspike
$ cd pyspike
```

### Setting Up Develop Environment

Install with `pip` in *editable* mode. This will setup development dependencies as well.

```shell
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

### Running Tests

Run the built-in test suite with `pytest`.

```shell
(.venv) $ python -m pytest -v
```

### Running Tests with Coverage

To enable coverage report, rebuild the extension module with `--cov` option, then re-run the test suite also with `--cov` option. You should see the coverage report by the end of the test output.

Note, if leaving out the first step, the C++ code will *not* show up in the coverage report.

```shell
(.venv) $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace --cov
(.venv) $ python -m pytest -v --cov
```

Optionally, you can generate HTML coverage report from the `lcov` data files.

```shell
(.venv) $ genhtml -o coverage --substitute "s#^#$PWD/#g" *.lcov
```

### Packaging

```shell
(.venv) $ python -m build
```

# jtool 🧃

`jtool` is a tool for humans and LLM agents to interact with Juypyter notebooks and servers.

Features:
- `jtool` enables any operation in the Jupyter GUI to be performed using a `jtool` cli command
- `jtool` enables LLM agents to read, write, and analyze jupyter notebooks (see [usage by LLM agents](#usage-by-llm-agents))
- `jtool` enables notebook-specific grep to search through notebooks' code, outputs, and markdown
- `jtool` enables easy memory usage tracking of each Jupyter server, notebook, and variable

## Installation

`jtool` is built in Rust but can be installed via `cargo`, `uv`, or `pip`

```bash
cargo install jtool
```

```bash
uv tool install jtool
```

```bash
pip install jtool
```

Alternatively, can just use `uvx run jtool` to run `jtool` without worrying about whether it has been installed.

## Example Usage

```bash
# List Jupyter servers
jtool servers

# Execute notebook cells
jtool execute-cells notebook.ipynb

# Read cells
jtool read-cells notebook.ipynb 0:5

# Edit cells
jtool edit-cell notebook.ipynb 3 --content "print('hello')"

# Show help
jtool --help
```

## Usage by LLM Agents

`jtool` is designed with LLM usage in mind

Compared to MCP-based solutions, CLI tools like `jtool` are more token-efficient, more composable, and have lower operational complexity. `jtool` is also fast and robust thanks to being written in rust.

### Token Efficiency
- `--max-output-lines N` - prevents output explosion from large cell outputs
- `--fields` - selective field extraction (only get what you need)
- `--inputs-only` / `--outputs-only` - filter noise
- `--compact` modes for summaries

### Composability
- CLI tools are much more composable than MCP servers
- calls to `jtool` can be chained together in scripts or complex bash calls

### Code Search and Understanding
- `jtool grep <regex>`: finds code patterns across notebooks
- `jtool errors`: print failures without re-execution
- `jtool imports`: discover dependencies
- summary - get quick notebook overview

### Safe Execution Controls
- `--timeout SECONDS` - prevent infinite loops
- `--max-output-lines` - limit output size
- Cell-level granularity (execute specific cells, not whole notebook)
- `--stream` for real-time feedback

### Documentation for LLM's
- See `agents/AGENTS.md` for a general prompt for teaching LLM agents to use `jtool`.
- See `agents/claude_skills` for usage of `jtool` documented as Claude skills.
- See `agents/prompts` for example prompts for using `jtool`.


## Syntax

`jtool` can use special syntax to reference servers, notebooks, and cells.

### Server References
Reference servers by full URL or port:
```bash
http://localhost:8888    # Full URL
8888                     # Port only (implies localhost)
```

### Notebook References
Multiple ways to reference notebooks:
```bash
path/to/notebook.ipynb   # Full path with .ipynb
path/to/notebook         # Path without .ipynb extension
notebook                 # Notebook name only (searches current directory)
8888:notebook            # Server:notebook (by port)
8888:path/to/notebook    # Server:path (by port)
@                        # Most recently used/modified notebook
```

### Cell References
Reference cells by index (0-based) or execution count:
```bash
# Single cell
3                        # Cell at index 3
_5                       # Cell with execution count 5

# Cell ranges (inclusive)
:                        # All cells
:5                       # From start to index 5
10:                      # From index 10 to end
3:8                      # From index 3 to 8
-3:                      # Last 3 cells to end
:-5                      # From start to 5th from end
-10:-5                   # From 10th from end to 5th from end

# Execution count ranges
_1:_10                   # From execution count 1 to 10
_5:                      # From execution count 5 onwards
:_20                     # Up to execution count 20
```

### Common Options
Many commands support these options for output control:
```bash
--json                    # Output as JSON
--csv                     # Output as CSV
--fields field1,field2    # Select specific fields
--head N                  # Limit to first N items
--max-output-lines N      # Limit cell output lines
--inputs-only             # Show only cell inputs
--outputs-only            # Show only cell outputs
--compact                 # Compact summary format
```

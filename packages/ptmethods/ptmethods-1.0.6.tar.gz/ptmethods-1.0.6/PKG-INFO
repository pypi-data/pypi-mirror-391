## PTMETHODS - HTTP Methods Testing Tool

- Script retrieves methods offered by server from OPTIONS request
- Script sends GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, DEBUG, FOO headers and returns server response
- Script tests CONNECT method by connecting to URL at ports 80, 443
- Script tests if domain can be used as a proxy

## Installation
```
pip install ptmethods
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples
Optimally use this script against homepage, any image and sources protected by HTTP authentication
```
ptmethods -u https://www.example.com/
ptmethods -u https://www.example.com/ -r
ptmethods -u https://www.example.com/index.php -sr -sh

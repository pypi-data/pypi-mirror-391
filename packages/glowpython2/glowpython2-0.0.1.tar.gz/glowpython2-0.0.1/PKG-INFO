               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

# GlowPython
The FORTRAN GLobal airglOW ([GLOW](https://github.com/NCAR/GLOW)) Model in Python &ge; 3.9.

A Fortran compiler is **REQUIRED**.

<b>Note:</b> This version uses `meson` and `ninja` as the build system, and does not rely on `distutils`,
and is Python 3.12 compatible.

<b>This library also allows parallelization of model evaluation using the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module.</b>

Additionally, the `GlowModel` class exposes complete control over model evaluation, which is divided
into the following fundamental steps:
1. `initialize`: Set the altitude, energy grids and solar flux model (Hinteregger, EUVAC, custom).
2. `setup`: Set the model up for evaluation, specifying time, location, and optionally geomagnetic parameters. If geomagnetic parameters are not specified, they are retrieved using [`geomagdata`](https://pypi.org/project/geomagdata/).
3. `precipitation` (optional): Evaluate the energy and flux of precipitating electrons (Maxwellian or monoenergetic).
4. `atmosphere`: Evaluate the neutral atmosphere (MSISE-00) and ionosphere (IRI-90).
5. `radtrans`: Evaluate the GLOW radiative transfer model to calculate volume emission rates and ion composition.
6. `result`: Retrieve the model output as a [xarray.Dataset](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html).

<b>Note:</b> Between the `atmosphere` and `radtrans` steps, the intermediate dataset can be accessed using the `result` method by passing `copy=False`. This returns a reference to the internal dataset. Modifying the dataset in place allows for modifying the atmosphere and ionosphere presented to the `radtrans` step.

## Prerequisites
A Fortran compiler is **REQUIRED**.
### Linux
Ensure that you have the following development packages installed:
- `build-essential` (for `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, etc.)
- `gfortran` (Fortran compiler)
### macOS
Ensure that you have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed. You can install them by running:
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
Install [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already, and then install `gfortran`:
```sh
brew install gfortran
```
<b>Note:</b> For macOS Big Sur and above, you may need to add the following line to your environment script (`~/.zshrc` if using ZSH, or the relevant shell init script):
```sh
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib"
```
Then reopen the terminal. This fixes the issue where `-lSystem` fails for `gfortran`. 
### Windows
The Windows installation is not officially supported at this time. However, you can try installing the [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) toolchain and ensure that `gfortran` is available in your system's PATH. You may also consider using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to set up a Linux-like environment on your Windows machine.
## Installation
Direct installation using pip:
```sh
pip install glowpython2
```

Install from source repository:
```sh
pip install glowpython2@git+https://github.com/sunipkm/glowpython2
```

Requires (and installs) [geomagdata](https://pypi.org/project/geomagdata/) for timezone aware geomagnetic parameter retrieval.
## Usage
### Pre-defined examples

* [`Maxwellian.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunipkm/glowpython2/refs/heads/master/Examples/Maxwellian.py): Maxwellian precipitation, specify Q (flux) and E0 (characteristic energy).
* [`NoPrecipitation.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunipkm/glowpython2/refs/heads/master/Examples/NoPrecipitation.py): No precipitating electrons.
* [`test_glow.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunipkm/glowpython2/refs/heads/master/tests/test_glow.py): Compares GLOW results between `glowpython` and `glowpython2` modules without precipitation, as well as with NRLMSISE-2.1 atmosphere and IRI-2020 ionosphere.

These examples are also available on the command line: `Glow2Maxwellian` and `Glow2NoPrecip`.

### Using `glowpython2` module
In Python source code, import the module and call the `maxwellian` function:
```python
import glowpython2 as glow

iono = glow.maxwellian(time, glat, glon, Nbins, Q, Echar)
```

Read the module documentation for more information.

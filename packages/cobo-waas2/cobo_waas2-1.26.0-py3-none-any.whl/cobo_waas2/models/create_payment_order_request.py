For details, see [Funds allocation and balances](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/payments/amounts-and-balances).  - **Denomination:**     The denomination of `fee_amount` depends on the presence of `currency`:       - If `currency` is set, the amount is denominated in that currency (e.g., \"USD\").       - If `currency` is not set, the amount is denominated in the cryptocurrency specified by `token_id` (e.g., \"ETH_USDT\").  - **Calculation:**     The developer fee is added to the base order amount (`order_amount`) to determine the final amount charged to the customer.     For example:       - Base amount (`order_amount`): \"100.00\"       - Developer fee (`fee_amount`): \"2.00\"       - **Total charged:** \"102.00\"  - **Formatting:**     The value can contain up to two decimal places.

description: Generate quality checklist for specification - validates specification quality, NOT implementation correctness
---

## Checklist Purpose: "Unit Tests for Domain Specifications"

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Checklists are **UNIT TESTS FOR SPECIFICATION WRITING** - they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of specifications.

**NOT for implementation verification**:
- ❌ "Verify parser handles specification correctly"
- ❌ "Test validator catches specification violations"
- ❌ "Confirm toolkit implements specification"

**FOR specification quality validation**:
- ✅ "Are all specification entities clearly defined? [Completeness]"
- ✅ "Are operation schemas consistently specified? [Consistency]"
- ✅ "Are error codes documented with examples? [Completeness]"
- ✅ "Can 'must be valid' be objectively measured? [Clarity]"

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This Command Does NOT Modify spec.md

**Checklist is a VALIDATION tool, NOT a modification tool.**

**What this command does**:
- ✅ Read `specs/domain/XXX-name/spec.md`
- ✅ Generate/update `checklists/comprehensive-quality.md`
- ✅ Identify issues (✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing)
- ✅ Track improvement across iterations

**What this command does NOT do**:
- ❌ Modify `spec.md`
- ❌ Fix issues automatically
- ❌ Add missing fields or descriptions

**When issues are found, user should**:
- **Draft toolkit** (v0.x.x): Direct edit `spec.md` → Re-run checklist (update mode)
- **Released toolkit** (v1.x.x): Use `/metaspec.proposal` → `/metaspec.apply`

See `docs/evolution-guide.md` for decision guide.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Execution Flow

### 1. Check for existing checklist

**CRITICAL**: Before generating, check if checklist already exists:

```bash
ls specs/domain/XXX-name/checklists/
```

**If checklist exists**, ask user:

| Mode | Action | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **update** | Update scores/status, add iteration section | Specification improved, want to track progress |
| **new** | Create new checklist (backup existing) | Complete restart, different focus |
| **append** | Add new checklist for different focus | Existing checklist still valid, new aspect |

**Default**: If user says "re-run", "verify improvement" → choose **update** mode

**If NO checklist exists** → proceed to step 2

---

### 2. Clarify intent

Generate up to 3 contextual clarifying questions based on user input:

**Example questions**:
- "Should this checklist focus on entity definitions, operations, or both?"
- "Is this for specification review (pre-toolkit) or specification validation (post-toolkit)?"
- "Should we include constitution alignment checks?"

**Present options as table**:
| Option | Focus | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| A | Entity Definitions | Validates entity schemas, fields, constraints |
| B | Operations | Validates request/response schemas, error handling |
| C | Validation Rules | Validates rule completeness, consistency |
| D | All Above | Comprehensive specification quality check |

**Defaults if no interaction**:
- Focus: Entity Definitions + Operations
- Audience: Specification designer (self-review)
- Depth: Standard

### 3. Load specification context

**Read from**:
- `specs/domain/XXX-name/spec.md` (REQUIRED)
- `/memory/constitution.md` (REQUIRED)
- `specs/domain/XXX-name/checklists/` (REQUIRED - check existing checklists)
- `specs/domain/XXX-name/examples/` (if exists)
- `specs/domain/XXX-name/README.md` (if exists)

**DO NOT load** (these are toolkit-specific):
- ❌ plan.md (toolkit architecture)
- ❌ tasks.md (implementation tasks)
- ❌ Any files in `specs/toolkit/`

### 4. Generate or update checklist

#### Mode A: **new** mode (default if no existing checklist)

**Create**:
- Directory: `specs/domain/XXX-name/checklists/` (if not exists)
- Filename: `[domain].md` (e.g., `entity-design.md`, `operations.md`, `validation-rules.md`)
- Format: Sequential IDs starting from CHK001

#### Mode B: **update** mode (if checklist exists)

**Actions**:
1. Read existing checklist structure
2. Preserve all existing:
   - Item IDs (CHK001, CHK002, ...)
   - Categories
   - Evidence sections
   - Previous iteration results
3. Update:
   - ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing status
   - Evidence with new findings
4. Add **new section** at end:
   ```markdown
   ## 📊 Iteration N: [Date]
   
   ### Changes Since Last Check
   - [List specification improvements]
   
   ### Updated Scores
   - [Show before/after comparison]
   
   ### New Issues Found
   - [New checklist items if needed]
   ```

#### Mode C: **append** mode (different focus)

**Actions**:
1. Create new checklist file with different filename
2. Reference existing checklist: "See also: [existing-checklist].md"
3. Focus on new aspect (e.g., existing = entities, new = operations)

### 7. Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do

**❌ WRONG - Testing implementation**:
```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Verify toolkit parser handles specification correctly
- [ ] CHK002 - Test toolkit validator catches specification violations
- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm toolkit CLI works with specification
```

**✅ CORRECT - Testing specification quality**:
```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are specification parsing requirements specified? [Completeness, Spec §Parser Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are specification validation rules documented? [Completeness, Spec §Validation Rules]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are specification CLI interactions defined? [Completeness, Spec §Specification Interface]
```

### 8. Write checklist file

- Write to `specs/domain/XXX-name/checklists/[domain].md`
- Use checklist-template structure
- Include metadata (purpose, created date, spec reference)
- Group items by category
- Number sequentially (CHK001, CHK002, ...)

### 9. Report completion

#### For **new** mode:

```
✅ Checklist generated: entity-design.md

📋 Summary:
- Focus: Entity Definition Quality
- Items: 10
- Categories: 3
- Traceability: 100% (all items reference spec/constitution)

📁 Location: specs/domain/XXX-name/checklists/entity-design.md

🎯 Purpose:
This checklist validates the quality of specification entity definitions in spec.md.
It does NOT test if toolkit implements specification, but whether the specification is:
- Complete (all entities defined)
- Clear (types, constraints explicit)
- Consistent (follows constitution)
- Measurable (examples provided)

🔄 Next steps:
1. Review checklist items
2. Update spec.md to address gaps
3. Re-run /metaspec.sds.clarify if ambiguities found
4. Use /metaspec.sds.analyze for deeper review

💡 Usage:
- During specification review: Check items before toolkit development
- After specification draft: Verify specification completeness
```

#### For **update** mode:

```
✅ Checklist updated: entity-design.md

📊 Iteration N Summary:
- Items updated: 8/10
- Improved: 5 items (❌ → ⚠️ or ✅)
- New issues: 2 items
- Still failing: 1 item

📈 Progress:
- Previous score: 60% (6/10 passing)
- Current score: 80% (8/10 passing)
- Improvement: +20%

📁 Location: specs/domain/XXX-name/checklists/entity-design.md

🎯 Key improvements detected:
- CHK001: ❌ → ✅ (entities now have purpose statements)
- CHK003: ⚠️ → ✅ (all fields now typed)
- CHK005: ❌ → ⚠️ (partial validation rules added)

⚠️ Still needs work:
- CHK007: Examples still missing for 2/5 entities

🔄 Next steps:
1. Review updated scores
2. Address remaining ❌ and ⚠️ items
3. Re-run checklist after next iteration
- Before release: Ensure specification is production-ready
```

## Important Notes

1. **Test the specification spec, not the implementation**
   - Ask: "Is X specified in specification?" not "Does toolkit implement X?"
   - Focus on specification quality, not toolkit correctness
   - Check completeness, clarity, consistency

2. **Traceability is mandatory**
   - Every item should reference [Spec §X], [Gap], [Constitution §Y]
   - Minimum 80% items with traceability markers
   - Makes it easy to find and fix specification issues

3. **Categories by quality dimension**
   - Group by: Completeness, Clarity, Consistency, Coverage
   - Not by: Implementation area (parser, validator, CLI)
   - Helps identify systematic specification quality issues

4. **Focus on specification-specific concerns**
   - Entity definition simplicity
   - Operation specification completeness
   - Validation rule clarity
   - Error handling consistency
   - Constitution alignment

5. **Multiple checklists allowed**
   - `entity-design.md` - Entity definition quality
   - `operations.md` - Operation specification quality
   - `validation.md` - Validation rules quality
   - `error-handling.md` - Error handling completeness
   - `constitution.md` - Constitution alignment
   - `examples.md` - Examples coverage

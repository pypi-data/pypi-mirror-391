## Introduction

The **Aignostics Python SDK** includes multiple pathways to interact with the
**Aignostics Platform**:

1. Use the **Aignostics Launchpad** to analyze whole slide images with advanced computational pathology applications like
   [Atlas H&E-TME](https://www.aignostics.com/products/he-tme-profiling-product) directly from your desktop.
   View your results by launching popular tools such as [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) and Python Notebooks with one click.
   The app runs on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
2. Use the **Aignostics Command-line interface (CLI)** to run applications directly from your terminal or shell scripts.
   THe CLI lets you query public datasets from the [NCI Image Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/),
   process both public and private whole slide images, and easily download results. The CLI is available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
3. Use the included **example notebooks** as starting points to run applications
   directly from your preferred notebook environment. We support Marimo and Jupyter based notebooks environments including Google Collab.
4. Use the **Aignostics Client Library** to seamlessly integrate the Aignostics Platform with your enterprise image management systems and scientific workflows.
   The client provides a simple way to access the Aignostics Platform API from your Python codebase. We support Python 3.11 and above.

> If you are not familiar with terminology please check the glossary at the end of this document.

### Launchpad: Run your first computational pathology analysis in 10 minutes from your desktop

The **Aignostics Launchpad** is a graphical desktop application that allows you to run
applications on whole slide images (WSIs) from your computer, and inspect results with QuPath and Python Notebooks with one click. It is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, for use by Research Pathologists and Data Scientists.

The Launchpad is available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, and can be installed easily:

1. Visit the [Quick Start](https://platform.aignostics.com/getting-started/quick-start)
   page in the Aignostics Console.
2. Copy the installation script and paste it into your terminal - compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
3. Launch the application by running `uvx aignostics launchpad`.
4. Follow the intuitive graphical interface to analyze public datasets or your own whole slide images
   with [Atlas H&E-TME](https://www.aignostics.com/products/he-tme-profiling-product) and other computational pathology applications.

> [!Note]
> The Launchpad features a growing ecosystem of extensions that seamlessly integrate with standard digital pathology tools. To use the Launchpad with all available extensions, run `uvx --from "aignostics[qupath,marimo]" aignostics launchpad`. Currently available extensions are:
>
> 1. **QuPath extension**: View your application results in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) with a single click. The Launchpad creates QuPath projects on-the-fly.
> 2. **Marimo extension**: Analyze your application results using [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks embedded in the Launchpad. You don't have to leave the Launchpad to do real data science.

### CLI: Manage datasets and application runs from your terminal

The Python SDK includes the **Aignostics CLI**, a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to
interact with the Aignostics Platform directly from your terminal or shell script.

See as follows for a simple example where we download a sample dataset for the [Atlas
H&E-TME application](https://www.aignostics.com/products/he-tme-profiling-product), submit an application run, and download the results.

```shell
# Download a sample dataset from the NCI Image Data Commons (IDC) portal to your current working directory
# As the dataset id refers to the TCGA LUAD collection, this creates a directory tcga_luad with the DICOM files
uvx aignostics dataset idc download 1.3.6.1.4.1.5962.99.1.1069745200.1645485340.1637452317744.2.0 data/
# Prepare the metadata for the application run by creating a metadata.csv, extracting 
# the required metadata from the DICOM files. We furthermore add the required
# information about the tissue type and disease. TODO (Helmut): Update
uvx aignostics application run prepare he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv data/
# Edit the metadata.csv to insert the required information about the staining method, tissue type and disease
# Adapt to your favourite editor
nano tcga_luad/metadata.csv 
# Upload the metadata.csv and referenced whole slide images to the Aignostics Platform
uvx aignostics application run upload he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv
# Submit the application run and print tha run id
uvx aignostics application run submit he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv
# Check the status of the application run you submitted
uvx aignostics application run list
# Incrementally download results when they become available
# Fill in the id from the output in the previous step
uvx aignostics application run result download APPLICATION_RUN_ID 
```

For convenience the the `application run execute` command combines preparation, upload, submission and download.
The below is equivalent to the above, while adding additionally required metadata using a mapping:

```shell
uvx aignostics dataset idc download 1.3.6.1.4.1.5962.99.1.1069745200.1645485340.1637452317744.2.0 data/
uvx aignostics application run execute he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv data/ ".*\.dcm:staining_method=H&E,tissue=LUNG,disease=LUNG_CANCER"
```

The CLI provides extensive help:

```shell
uvx aignostics --help                           # list all spaces such as application, dataset, bucket and system, 
uvx aignostics application --help               # list subcommands in the application space
uvx aignostics application run --help           # list subcommands in the application run sub-space
uvx aignostics application run list --help      # show help for specific command
uvx aignostics application run execute --help   # show help for another command
```

Check out our
[CLI reference documentation](https://aignostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_reference.html)
to learn about all commands and options available.

uv add aignostics
```

**Install with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)**

```shell
# Add Python SDK as dependency to your project
pip install aignostics
```

#### Usage

The following snippet shows how to use the Client to submit an application
run:

```python
from aignostics import platform

# initialize the client
client = platform.Client()
# submit an application run
application_run = client.runs.submit(
   application_id="test-app",
   items=[
      platform.InputItem(
         external_id="slide-1",
         input_artifacts=[
            platform.InputArtifact(
               name="whole_slide_image",
               download_url="<a signed url to download the data>",
               metadata={
                  "checksum_base64_crc32c": "AAAAAA==",
                  "resolution_mpp": 0.25,
                  "width_px": 1000,
                  "height_px": 1000,
               },
            )
         ],
      ),
   ],
)
# wait for the results and download incrementally as they become available
application_run.download_to_folder("path/to/download/folder")
```

Please look at the notebooks in the `example` folder for a more detailed example
and read the
[client reference documentation](https://aignostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lib_reference.html)
to learn about all classes and methods.

##### Defining the input for an application run

When creating an application run, you need to specify the `application_id` and optionally the
`application_version` (version number) of the application you want to run. If you omit the version,
the latest version will be used automatically. Additionally, you need to define the input items you
want to process in the run. The input items are defined as follows:

```python
platform.InputItem(
    external_id="1",
    input_artifacts=[
        platform.InputArtifact(
            name="whole_slide_image", # defined by the application version's input artifact schema
            download_url="<a signed url to download the data>",
            metadata={ # defined by the application version's input artifact schema
                "checksum_base64_crc32c": "N+LWCg==",
                "resolution_mpp": 0.46499982,
                "width_px": 3728,
                "height_px": 3640,
            },
        )
    ],
),
```

For each item you want to process, you need to provide a unique `reference`
string. This is used to identify the item in the results later on. The
`input_artifacts` field is a list of `InputArtifact` objects, which defines what
data & metadata you need to provide for each item. The required artifacts depend
on the application version you want to run - in the case of test application,
there is only one artifact required, which is the image to process on. The
artifact name is defined as `whole_slide_image` for this application.

The `download_url` is a signed URL that allows the Aignostics Platform to
download the image data later during processing.

#### Self-signed URLs for large files

To make the whole slide images you want to process available to the Aignostics Platform, you
need to provide a signed URL that allows the platform to download the data.
Self-signed URLs for files in google storage buckets can be generated using the
`generate_signed_url`
([code](https://github.com/aignostics/python-sdk/blob/407e74f7ae89289b70efd86cbda59ec7414050d5/src/aignostics/client/utils.py#L85)).

**We expect that you provide the
[required credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)
for the Google Storage Bucket**


## Platform

### Overview

The **Aignostics Platform** is a comprehensive cloud-based service that allows organizations to leverage advanced computational pathology applications without the need for specialized expertise or complex infrastructure. Via its API it provides a standardized, secure interface for accessing Aignostics' portfolio of advanced computational pathology applications. These applications perform machine learning based tissue and cell analysis on histopathology slides, delivering quantitative measurements, visual representations, and detailed statistical data.

![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aignostics/python-sdk/main/platform.png)

### Key Features
Aignostics Platform offers key features designed to maximize value for its users:

1. **Run Aignostics applications:** Run Aignostics advanced computational pathology applications like [Atlas H&E-TME](https://www.aignostics.com/products/he-tme-profiling-product) on your whole slide images (WSIs) and receive results in a easy to inspect formats.
2. **Multiple Access Points:** Interact with the platform via various pathways, from **Aignostics Launchpad** (desktop application for MacOS, Windows and Linux), **Aignostics CLI** (command-line interface for your terminal or shell scripts), **Example Notebooks** (we support Jupyter and Marimo), **Aignostics Client Library** (for integration with your Python codebase), or directly through the **API of the Aignostics Platform** (for integration with any programming language). Contact your business partner at Aignostics if you are interested to discuss a direct integration with your Imaging Management Systems (IMS) and Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS).
3. **Secure Data Handling:** Maintain control of your slide data through secure self-signed URLs. Results are automatically deleted after 30 days, and can be deleted earlier by the user.
4. **High-throughput processing with incremental results delivery:** Submit up to 500 whole slide images (WSI) in one batch request. Access results for individual slides as they completed processing, without having to wait for the entire batch to finish.
5. **Standard formats:** Support for commonly used image formats in digital pathology such as pyramidal DICOM, TIFF, and SVS. Results provided in standard formats like QuPath GeoJSON (polygons), TIFF (heatmaps) and CSV (measurements and statistics).

### Registration and User Access

To start using the Aignostics Platform and its advanced applications, your organization must be registered by our business support team:

1. Access to the Aignostics Platform requires a formal business agreement. Once an agreement is in place between your organization and Aignostics, we proceed with your organization's registration. If your organization does not yet have an account, please contact your account manager or email us at [support@aignostics.com](mailto:support@aignostics.com) to express your interest.
2. To register your organization, we require the name and email address of at least one employee, who will be assigned the Administrator role for your organisation. Your organisation's Administrator can invite and manage additional users. 

> [!Important]
> 1. All user accounts must be associated with your organization's official domain. We do not support the registration of private or personal email addresses.
> 2. For security, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mandatory for all user accounts.
> 3. We can integrate with your IDP system (e.g. SAML, OIDC) for user authentication. Please contact us to discuss the integration.
> 4. Registering your organistation typically takes 2 business days depending on the complexity of the signed business agreement and specific requirements.

### Console

The web-based [*Aignostics Console*](https://platform.aignostics.com) is a user-friendly interface that allows you to 
manage your organization, applications, quotas, and users registered with the Aignostics Platform.

1. The Console is available to users registered for your organisation to manage their profile and monitor usage of their quota.
2. Administrators of your organization can invite additional users, manage the organisation and user specific quotas and monitor usage.
3. Both roles can trigger application runs.

### Applications
An application is a fully automated advanced machine learning based workflow composed of one or more specific tasks (e.g. Tissue Quality Control, Tissue Segmentation, Cell Detection, Cell Classification and predictive analysis). Each application is designed for a particular analysis purpose (e.g. Tumor Micro Environment analysis or biomarker scoring). For each application we define input requirements, processing tasks and output formats.

As contracted in your business agreement with Aignostics your organisation subscribes to one or more applications. The applications are available for your organization in the Aignostics Platform. You can find the list of available applications in the Console of the Aignostics Platform.

Each application can have multiple versions. Please make sure you read dedicated application documentation to understand its specific constraints regarding acceptable formats, staining method, tissue types and diseases.

Once registered to the Platform, your organization will automatically gain access to the "Test Application". This application can be used to configure the workflow and to make sure that the integration works correctly.


### Application run

To trigger the application run, users can use the Aignostics Launchpad, Aignostics CLI, Example Notebooks, our Client Library, or directly call the REST API. The platform expects the user payload, containing the metadata and the signed URLs to the whole slide images (WSIs). The detailed requirements of the payload depend on the application and are described in the documentation, and accessible via the Info button in the Launchpad, as well as via the CLI and `/v1/applications` endpoint in the API.

When the application run is created, it can be in one of the following states:

1. **received**: the application run received from the client
2. **scheduled**: the application run request is valid and is scheduled for execution
3. **running**: the application run execution started
4. **completed**: the application run execution is done and all outputs are available for download
5. **completed**: the application run execution is done, but some items end up in the failed state
6. **rejected**: the application run request is rejected before it is scheduled
7. **cancelled by the system**: the application run failed during the execution with the number of errors higher than the threshold
9. **cancelled by the user**: the application run is cancelled by the user before it is finished

The status and operations of an application run are private to the user who triggered the run.

### Results
When the processing of whole slide image is successfully completed, the resulting outputs become available for download. To assess specifics of application outputs please consult our application specific documentation, which you can find in the **Console**. Please note that you access to documentation is restricted to those applications your organisation subscribed to.

Application run outputs are automatically deleted 30 days after the application run has completed. However, the owner of the application run (the user who initiated it) can use the API to manually delete outputs earlier, once the run has reached a final state - completed, cancelled by the system or cancelled by the user. The Launchpad and CLI provide enable to delete results with one click resp. command.

### Quotas
Every organization has a limit on how many WSIs it can process in a calendar month. The following quotas exist:

1. **Per organization**: as defined in your business agreement with Aignostics
2. **Per user**: defined by your organization Admin

When the per month quota is reached, an application run request is denied.

Other limitations may apply to your organization:

1. Allowed number of users an organization can register
2. Allowed number of images user can submit per application run
3. Allowed number of parallel application runs for the whole organization

Additionally, we allow organization Admin to define following limitations for its users:

1. Maximum number of images the user can process per calendar month.
2. Maximum number of parallel application runs for a given user

Visit the [Console](https://platform.aignostics.com) to check your current quota and usage. The Console provides a clear overview of the number of images processed by your organization and by each user, as well as the remaining quota for the current month.

### API

The **Aignostics Platform API** is a RESTful web service that allows you to interact with the platform programmatically. It provides endpoints for submitting whole slide images (WSIs) for analysis, checking the status of application runs, and retrieving results.

You can interact with the API using the Python client, which is a wrapper around the RESTful API. The Python client simplifies the process of making requests to the API and handling responses. It also provides convenient methods for uploading WSIs, checking application run status, and downloading results.

For integration with programming languages other than Python, you can use the RESTful API directly. The API is designed to be language-agnostic, meaning you can use any programming language that supports HTTP requests to interact with it. This includes languages like Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, and Typescript. 

### Cost

Every WSI processed by the Platform generates a cost. Usage of the "Test Application" is free of charge for any registered user. The cost for other applications is defined in your business agreement with Aignostics. The cost is calculated based on the number of slides processed. When an application run is cancelled, either by the system or by the user, only processed images incur a cost.

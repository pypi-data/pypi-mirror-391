# Place this file at: ~/.orcastrator_config
#
# All paths support ~ for home directory expansion
# All settings are optional - Orcastrator will use sensible defaults if not specified

# openmpi_path = "/opt/openmpi"

# Default scratch directory for calculations
# Defaults to /scratch (or /tmp if /scratch doesn't exist)

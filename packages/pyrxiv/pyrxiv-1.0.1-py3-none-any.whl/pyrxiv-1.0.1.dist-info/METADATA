# pyrxiv

**pyrxiv** is a Python package for retrieving [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) papers, storing their metadata in [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)-like classes, and optionally filtering some of them out based on the specific content of the papers (matching a regex pattern).

While originally developed for the **Strongly Correlated Electron Systems** community in Condensed Matter Physics ([`cond-mat.str-el`](https://arxiv.org/list/cond-mat.str-el/recent)), it's designed to be flexible and applicable to **any arXiv category**.

Install the core package:
```bash
pip install pyrxiv
```

## Objective
**pyrxiv** main objective is to provide an easy command line interface (CLI) to search and download arXiv papers which contain a specific content string matched against a regex pattern. By default, the arXiv PDFs are downloaded. You can optionally save metadata to HDF5 files. You can use the CLI and print the options after installing the package using:
```bash
pyrxiv --help
```

or directly:
```bash
pyrxiv search_and_download --help
```

For example, to download PDFs:
```bash
pyrxiv search_and_download --category cond-mat.str-el --regex-pattern "DMFT|Hubbard" --n-papers 5
```

Or to also save metadata to HDF5 files:
```bash
pyrxiv search_and_download --category cond-mat.str-el --regex-pattern "DMFT|Hubbard" --n-papers 5 --save-hdf5
```

**Note**: When using `--regex-pattern`, the tool will continue fetching papers from arXiv until it finds the specified number of papers (`--n-papers`) that match the pattern. Papers that don't match the regex are automatically discarded.

## Documentation

For a comprehensive guide on how to use the CLI and recommended pipelines, see the [How to Use `pyrxiv`](docs/how_to_use_pyrxiv.md) documentation.

# Development

To contribute to `pyrxiv` or run it locally, follow these steps:


## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosePizarro3/pyrxiv.git
cd pyrxiv
```

## Set Up a Virtual Environment

We recommend Python ≥ 3.10:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies

Use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (faster than pip) to install the package in editable mode with `dev` extras:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install uv
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Run tests

Use `pytest` with verbosity to run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest -sv tests
```


To check code coverage:
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=pyrxiv tests
```

### Code formatting and linting


We use [`Ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for formatting and linting (configured via `pyproject.toml`).

Check linting issues:
```bash
ruff check .
```

Auto-format code:
```bash
ruff format .
```

Manually fix anything Ruff cannot handle automatically.

"""
Response models for the Naxai Webhooks API.

This module defines Pydantic models that represent responses from webhook-related API
endpoints, providing strongly-typed structures for webhook management and event tracking.
It includes models for:

- Webhook configurations: Base models and responses for creating, retrieving, updating,
  and listing webhooks
- Event tracking: Models for webhook event data and event history
- Event types: Models for available event types that can be subscribed to

The models handle JSON parsing with special handling for array responses, field aliases
for snake_case to camelCase conversion, and provide list-like behavior for collection
responses to simplify iteration and access.

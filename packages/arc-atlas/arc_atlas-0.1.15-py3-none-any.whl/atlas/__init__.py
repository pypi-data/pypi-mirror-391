"""Atlas SDK public API.

This module re-exports the most common entry points a developer needs when
embedding Atlas into their own systems:

* Runtime orchestration helpers (``run`` / ``arun``)
* Student / Teacher personas for tailoring behaviour
* Connector registry helpers for registering Bring-Your-Own-Agent adapters
* Runtime schemas used by the training stack
* Reward evaluator facade
* JSONL exporter utilities for turning persisted sessions into datasets

The re-exported surface mirrors the conceptual layers documented in the Atlas
core repository—``personas``, ``connectors``, ``runtime``, ``evaluation``, and
``cli``.

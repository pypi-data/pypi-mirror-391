🎨 ASCII Pal

A simple, fun command-line tool that prints random ASCII art figures to your terminal.

This package is a demonstration project for learning how to publish to PyPI (the Python Package Index).

Installation

You can install asciipal directly from PyPI using pip:

pip install asciipal


How to Use

asciipal has two primary uses: as a quick command-line tool or as a simple function in your own Python scripts.

1. As a Command-Line Tool (Primary Use)

This is the main way to use the package. After installing, simply type asciipal into your terminal and press Enter.

$ asciipal


A random ASCII figure will be printed to your console:

  /\_/\
 ( o.o )
  > ^ <


Run it again to get a different one!

$ asciipal

   __
--(oo)
  (__)


2. As a Python Module (Optional)

You can also import and use the run function within your own Python code if you wish.

# Import the run function from the asciipal package
from asciipal.main import run

# Call the function to print a random ASCII figure
print("Here is your first pal:")
run()

print("\nAnd here is another:")
run()
